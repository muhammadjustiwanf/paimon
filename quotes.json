  "The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep... So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...",
  "You sure have been to many worlds, haven't you?",
  "If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!",
  "Also, windmills are what they call 'visible winds' and wind chimes are the 'audible winds.'",
  "Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of 463 different ways of dying in these domains...",
  "Paimon guesses they can be thought of as mascots and prayers to the Anemo Archon for protection.",
  "Just look at Huffman from the Knights of Favonius. He does his best at his duties every day... But the ever-relaxed Captain Kaeya is his boss.",
  "Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!",
  "Ahh...",
  "Paimon has a special stomach just for tasty drinks!",
  "Ooh, Paimon's heard this one. In Liyue, they call this 'a joust for a spouse'!",
  "Paimon finds that hard work hardly works here in Mondstadt.",
  "You mean the Angel's Share? But Master Diluc seems like a very rich man. How big a tip is 'considerable,' anyway?",
  "Yup, yup. You've got to respect your food. ...Wh\u2014What are you looking at Paimon for?",
  "No! Not at all! They're made of wood, and you can't eat them in an emergency either, cause all you'd do is grind your teeth down!",
  "Come to think of it, while Rex Lapis enjoys visiting his people in private, he only descends officially once every year. None of the other gods do this. Hmm... Does Rex Lapis have any deeper intentions?",
  "Paimon's heard that in Liyue, people call the crane the 'gentleman bird.'",
  "Wow \u2014 the abode of the adepti!",
  "Wow \u2014 meeting adepti!",
  "Oh? Do you know how to read the stars, too? That's amazing! Not a lot of people outside Sumeru can do it. Paimon's curious! Come on, do a reading for me, quick!",
  "Cider Lake never freezes, no matter what time of year it is. The best apple ciders in Mondstadt can only be made from the fresh waters from this lake! It really does taste great! Paimon could drink two big bottles in a second!",
  "Huh? But 'The Boar Princess' isn't in the restricted section! What could be more unsuitable for children than that? ...Hmm, Paimon's curious...",
  "Heh, right... your theory sounds as rock solid as a Geo Slime... And about as brainy, too.",
  "Paimon doesn't care who you are, making a deal with the Tsaritsa is super dangerous!",
  "Ahem. Well... Paimon thinks that shouting from the mountaintop should work.",
  "You sure have been to many worlds, haven't you?",
  "There's a saying of Rex Lapis' that's commonly used here in Liyue. Paimon thinks its rough meaning is... 'Don't play with your money.'",
  "Paimon thinks so too! The rooms are sure to be big and clean.",
  "True. The Anemo Archon is just a Tone-Deaf Bard. What does he know about the wind?",
  "The Guhua Clan, huh? Paimon bets it's a heroic story!",
  "Wow \u2014 communicating with adepti!",
  "Did you know the reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper? The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes. It's all very sophisticated.",
  "Paimon thinks only having one stomach is weird!",
  "Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!",
  "Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!",
  "Mondstadt has so many windmills, doesn't it?",

  "Also, windmills are what they call 'visible winds' and wind chimes are the 'audible winds.'",
  "If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared. Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double- and triple-check your supplies in advance.",
  "W\u2014Well, how about this, then... Venti's the god of Mondstadt, and he's the laziest of them all!",
  "The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep... So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...",
  "Why don't we ask Venti?",
  "Huh? But 'The Boar Princess' isn't in the restricted section! What could be more unsuitable for children than that? ...Hmm, Paimon's curious...",
  "A Slime Creator!",
  "It's because the first Mora were minted from his golden form and given to humans in trust.",

  "If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!",
  "Ah! Paimon gets it now. Paimon would be offering Rex Lapis' favorite snacks to him every day! If you could just get Mora straight from Morax's hands, who would ever need to do a day of honest work?",
  "Ooh, Paimon's heard this one. In Liyue, they call this 'a joust for a spouse'!",
