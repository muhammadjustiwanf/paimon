Eventually, the people of Liyue would tell tales of an era of catastrophe and a nameless yaksha,Tales of how heroes from disparate heritages and different lands united under a single banner against the Abyss...Inevitably, the tale would touch upon the cup, and how the blood of those that went before remained clear and spotless as the day it was spilled.\n"
