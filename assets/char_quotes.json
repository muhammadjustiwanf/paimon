 "Albedo": [
  " I am Albedo, Chief Alchemist of the Knights of Favonius. You carry the aura of the stars, interesting... I would like to study you, if you do not mind. I'm certain we will have many opportunities to be alone in the future.",
  " What a view... How about a quick break so I can sketch this beautiful scenery?",
  " \"The truth of this world\"... *sigh* What could it be?",
  " Going out into the world and investigating, turning the \"unknown\" into the \"known.\" ...Ahhh, I missed this feeling.",
  " The soil is moist, ideal for collecting the roots of Boom Blossoms. No please, allow me to handle this.",
  " Master...",
  " Ample light... active biological organisms... Yes, this is a good place to sketch.",
  " Good morning. Are we going to search for ancient relics today?",
  " Good afternoon. I heard your footsteps. My, it certainly is lively outside of the workshop.",
  " *sigh* It's gotten quiet outside...",
  " Good night, you go ahead and rest. I will just finish one last experiment before bed... If you are interested in the results, I can discuss them with you tomorrow.",
  " Genius? ...A number of people call me that. But I don't think I'm any \"genius.\"",
  " Relationships are... quite troublesome. Once you establish a relation with someone, you must continue to maintain it; if you lose contact, you must reestablish the relation. This taxing cycle requires a lot of time...",
  " You... want to accompany me while I experiment? I'm honored.Oh, don't be nervous. My experiments may be dangerous, but no one gets hurt... most of the time.",
  " Would you oblige me by serving as my assistant? After observing so many experiments, you surely know a good deal about alchemy by now. Relax, we will work together. I don't think you will have any problems. I have faith in my ability to instruct you, and even more faith in your exceptional talents.",
  " My Vision? Ah, that's nothing more than a tool to aid in my experiments, no different from a beaker or crucible. The one thing about it that really intrigues me is the principle behind how it works... One day, I will uncover its secrets, it's only a matter of time.",
  " There's something I've always wanted to ask you, but feared rejection and disappointment...Eh-hem... I am very interested in your little floating companion. May I borrow her to investigate for a short while?",
  " You would like to know more about petrified trees? Erm... Actually, the petrified trees you have come across in domains aren't that ancient. Truly ancient trees usually grow to around one or two miles in height. Oh, and there's a kind of large spider that lives around their roots \u2014 if you tie one up in cape jasmine and lemongrass and sprinkle on some cardamom, smoke it for a few hours \u2014 you get a fragrant taste that's simply... unforgettable.",
  " Family? Although Alice has always asked me to call her mother.... when I think of the idea of \"family\", my master comes to mind first. My earliest memories in life are of going on adventures with her. She taught me the art of alchemy and much knowledge about the world. Perhaps... even the words \"family\" and \"master\" are incapable of fully expressing her meaning to me.",
  " Sucrose? I think I more or less understand why she is so dedicated to her research in bio-alchemy... Either way, I'm happy to see her succeed more and more in her endeavors.",
  " Working with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research. For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me \"Albedo\" since we are about the same age, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. ...Whatever she prefers, I guess.",
  " Lisa? I always am impressed by the valuable perspectives she brings to discussions. But is a person with her talents satisfied with such a basic occupation as librarian? There must be some hidden reason for this.",
  " Indeed, I view Klee as my younger sister. Whenever she gets herself into some explosive sort of trouble, I can only console myself with the fact that her current destructiveness is nothing compared to that of Miss Alice.",
  " Jean? She has served exceptionally well as Acting Grand Master, one can even say she is more reliable than Grand Master Varka. Perhaps in our hearts, we all eagerly await the day she can become the official Grand Master herself.",
  " Oh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?",
  " Barbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort.",
  " Have a question for me? Go ahead, ask. It doesn't take too long to ask a single question, does it? I'm about to begin the final stage of an experiment...",
  " Oh, by the way. Did you know that without human manipulation, you would need to harness the power of a sun eight times the size of our own in order to naturally create gold?",
  " The time required to sketch portraits closely correlates with one's mood. I could spend half a day sketching Huffman, while I might only need three strokes of the pencil to sketch Kaeya \u2014 one for the face, one for the eyepatch string... and one for the eyepatch.",
  " What do I do besides sketching and research...? I will occasionally read novels from Inazuma and Liyue. They contain many fascinating ideas which can sometimes provide me with unexpected inspirations for my own creations.",
  " Even now, I find the nigredo processing stage of alchemy passed down by my master to be full of mystery. What did my master want to create using this technique...? My research is far from over, I will require your help to investigate further.",
  " Hmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching. At first I saw it simply as a way to better study the structure of living things and materials so as to aid me in my experiments, but it eventually became a hobby of mine. Indeed, it is a very good way to relax.",
  " There's just never enough time, is there? Even when I remove the most troublesome matters from my schedule, I still can't find enough time for everything.",
  " I really do enjoy having dessert. How can I put it...? When both physical and mental capacity are spent, high-energy materials further provide a kind of primordial, highly-effective boost.",
  " What food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy \u2014 either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted. I decided to simply not go to restaurants, although that has also meant I must spend more time preparing my own food...",
  " Happy birthday. You look especially happy, would you mind if I sketched you? The capacity of our brains is limited, so we are bound to forget things. But when an image is transferred onto paper or canvas, the sketch becomes an extension of our memory. We can remember that past feeling when we later look at the sketch.",
  " Nigredo is the first step in alchemy, drawing from primordial forms. As beings who live in this world, we must find our own meaning.",
  " Albedo is the step in which change begins. Clearing away the excess so we can take on all the knowledge that is available. Would you like to investigate this world with me?",
  " Rubedo in alchemy refers to the refining of feeling. I feel the refining of my own emotions is also thanks to you.",
  " Citrinitas is the final stage of the alchemical transmutation process. The meaning of the object being transmuted has finally been brought to light, becoming gold and revealing its true value... I too have found my own meaning."

  " Come on. Enough standing around, let's keep moving.",
  " Let's get going. There are people who need our help.",
  " Aloy here. I don't know this world, but my arrows are sharp and my bow's ready. If your party needs help, I'll do what I can.",
  " Rain. One way to wash off the grime.",
  " Sky's running out of rain for now. Time to dry off.",
  " The world always seems quieter when it snows.",
  " Wind's kicking up again. Feels good to breathe it in.",
  " Wind is really whipping now. My face feels raw.",
  " Morning. World's starting to stir again. Me too, I guess.",
  " Day's half over, but we still have a lot to do.",
  " Sunset. We'll be under the stars soon.",
  " Night's here. Time to rest, unless we're going on by starlight.",
  " I grew up an outcast, and it wasn't much fun. Even though I'm a stranger here, people are friendlier than the tribe that was supposed to raise me. It's... nice.",
  " Everything I do is in the service of life, not death. That's why I'm here with you.",
  " An oath seems like a formality. But if you want mine, you've got it.",
  " I'll do whatever it takes to finish this with you. I won't hesitate. I won't falter.",
  " If I have to share something, it'll be my bow... in the service of people who need the help.",
  " This land has a past full of secrets, just like my world. I'll uncover all of it, if I have enough time.",
  " I'm not much for talking about myself. The mission is what's important.",
  " I never had parents. But a man named Rost raised me. He was stern, but kind and generous. And he trained me well. I miss him.",
  " I spent my whole life looking for my mother and never found her, not really. But I found ancient messages from the woman I was... cloned from. It felt like she knew me. And how to inspire me.",
  " When I grew up, I didn't have any friends. Later in my travels, I made some. But I left that world before we could grow close. That's why I'm glad to have spent time with you.",
  " Trust doesn't come easy for me, but I know I can trust you. You're a true friend, and I don't say that often.",
  " Not sure if I have a hobby, unless you count reading things from the past. So, history... I guess?",
  " One world needed saving. Now another. There's never time to rest.",
  " I'm not picky. Anything's better than traveling on an empty stomach.",
  " Had an Oseram stew once that was so thick you could pave a road with it. Ugh.",
  " Never put much stock in birthdays. Where I come from, it's a time to celebrate your mother, not yourself. Even so, I wish you a, uh... happy day.",
  " All right. Feels like we're making progress, but we can't stop now.",
  " Getting better. Getting stronger. Always a good thing.",
  " No matter how good a hunter you are, you can always get better. Never rest. Never stop learning.",
  " When we started out, you were just another stranger in a world I didn't understand. But after everything we've been through, I can say this for certain: My bow is yours, now and always."

 "Amber": [
  " Outrider Amber reporting for duty! Just say the word if you ever need my help!",
  " I feel like running.",
  " Jean will be upset if she catches us lazing around like this.",
  " Hey, there's something strange over there... C'mon, let's take a look!",
  " Oh no, it's raining... now my uniform will get all wet...",
  " It's raining again... This will hinder our vision, we must remain vigilant!",
  " Wow~ This weather is awesome!",
  " If only the wind was a little stronger...",
  " This breeze... so refreshing!",
  " I love this kind of weather, ahh... so relaxing~",
  " Morning! Want to go on a jog?",
  " Can I get lunch with you?",
  " It's getting late, should I light a torch?",
  " Agreed, getting rest is essential! Let's meet here tomorrow then. See ya!",
  " Mondstadt Gliding Champion, yep, that's me! Gliding Champion!",
  " Remember that I don't go easy on anyone, even you!",
  " When I'm teaching you to glide, I feel like I can go even faster than usual... Huh? What are you laughing at? I'll prove it! We can race \u2014 right now!",
  " My Vision... Is a sign that the Archons believe in me. Yes, I must become the best Outrider I can possibly be!",
  " The view from the Cathedral's clock tower is amazing! You should check it out.",
  " Look, there's a pigeon over there! *giggle* I wish I could fly alongside them.",
  " After the Grand Master left on his expedition, all the affairs of the Knights of Favonius, both big and small, have been left up to Jean. If only there was more I could do to help her...",
  " Jean might still be working? We should invite her for coffee... Let's go.",
  " When you have time, we should go see Lisa! Last time I saw her, she was telling me about a story involving a treasure in the Dragonspine area. But, we got cut off before she could finish. I can't wait to hear the rest of her story!",
  " If Lisa's not sleeping, she'll be reading! I don't know how she does it, I wouldn't be able to sit still for that long.",
  " ...I'm feeling uneasy all of a sudden! Was that Kaeya with you earlier? Did he give you any trouble?",
  " There's something weird-looking about the dandelions in the garden... Hmm, I bet Kaeya had something to do with this!",
  " Hmm? Bennett... I feel like I've heard that name before... Oh! Yes, he's that hot-blooded guy from the Adventurers' Guild, right! I tend to come across him way out in the wild from time to time, he seems to really love treasure hunting.",
  " Klee? She can be a bit cheeky sometimes, but everyone in the Knights of Favonius likes her. Although... I really ought to keep a closer eye on her if I wanna keep her from getting put in confinement by Jean again.",
  " Albedo spends most of his time in his workshop, tinkering away with all of his awesome stuff. But, when you see him in person, you never can quite tell what he's thinking... Who knows what goes on in that mind of his...(Actual Voice-Over: Albedo spends most of his time in his workshop, tinkering away with all of his awesome stuff. But, when you see him in person, you can never quite tell what he's thinking... Not a clue at all...)",
  " You wanna know about Noelle? She's super resilient. Still, since she's younger than us we should still look out for her.(Actual Voice-Over: You wanna know about Noelle? She's incredibly resilient. Still, as our predecessor, we should do what we can to help her out.)",
  " Eula is a great friend of mine! You just need to get used to her sense of humor and you'll get along fine! The only reason she's misunderstood by so many people is her family name. How can I get them to see her for who she really is?",
  " I'm a pro at hunting, you know! How about I show you some of my skills? Or even better... how about a little competition?",
  " I'll share my ultimate Gliding Champion secret with you! The most important thing to remember, is to have courage!",
  " I'm really not that good with riddles. I always try to avoid the riddles stand during Ludi Harpastum... What about you?",
  " I joined the Knights because of my grandpa, I stayed because of Jean. ...And now, you're the one that showed me the world beyond Mondstadt. I couldn't be happier.",
  " I would like to explore the other worlds beyond. I wanna see how deep the rabbit hole goes! You'll keep me company right, right?",
  " Baron Bunny, today is another squeaky clean day!",
  " Oh... Do you have any idea how to make a decent Moon Pie?",
  " Jean makes the most amazing cup of coffee! You'll have to try it sometime.",
  " I can handle anything and everything! As long as it isn't cold Wolfhook juice... Ugh, yuck...",
  " Hey, Happy Birthday! Here, I have a gift for you: an exclusive, custom-made version of Baron Bunny that I sewed for you myself... Don't worry, \"custom-made\" means that it won't explode!",
  " Yeah! As fast as riding the wind!",
  " At this speed, no one can keep up with me!",
  " The skies over Mondstadt seem to have gotten smaller... or is it that my sight reaches further than ever before?",

I'll respond to whichever one you choose, I promise. Hehe, you're welcome.",
  " Arataki \"Numero Uno\" Itto, here in the flesh! Hahaha... *cough*",
  " Best flavor in the world? The sweet, sweet taste of victory. And that's why I've never spent a single Mora on any of my snacks \u2014 I've won 'em all fair and square... That's right.",
  " Don't underestimate the beetle \u2014 they can be some of the toughest little guys around! Yes you can, yes you can\u2014 Wanna know what's on this beetle's diet? Sweat and tears, that's what! That's how it gets stronger... I think we can all learn somethin' from that!",

  " Hey! Raiden Shogun, is that you? Well guess what \u2014 you're not the boss of me. Uh-huh, that's right, you heard me! Go ahead, strike me down!",
  " Alright, it's time for a snowball fight! You're never gonna win, though, I... Ha, ah... Ah-choo!!! Whew.",
  " The sky is clear and the sun is shining... Time to get the Onikabuto out for some training! C'mon little guy, let's go!",
  " Bottom line: Never let the wind get to you. Especially when you've got a killer hairstyle like mine. Oh yeah!",
  " Morning, sunshine! Hey, uh... So listen, I'm fresh out of Mora... again. But hey, who needs some lousy job when we can just go find somewhere fun to hang out! Haha, whaddya say?",
  " Now that we've had some grub, why don't we go find somewhere to kick it for a while? Hanamizaka? Nah, boring. Tenryou Commission... No, no, no... Ah, forget it, let's go hang around Ritou!",
  " Shh! You hear that? *gasp* Oh no... it's a ghost, RUN!!! ... Haha, psyche! Ah, I got you good there! ... I got you, didn't I?",
  " If you're tired, go ahead and call it a night. Hmm? Me? Oh, don't worry... I sleep with my eyes open... Haha... Literally.",
  " Oh, so they're saying I can't hold down a real job, huh? Well! Hahaha! Sorry to break it to ya, but I'm a delinquent. That means it's my job to not have a real job, and if anyone's got a problem with that... Who's got a problem with that, huh? You got a problem with that!? You got a problem with\u2014 *coughing* Sorry. Got a little worked up there. Where was I? Ah yeah, so work isn't really my thing, but don't worry \u2014 I don't rob or steal or anything like that. When I'm really runnin' low on funds, I just take the odd job here and there to make ends meet. You know, like transporting stuff, delivering documents, helping businesses attract customers... Just enough to keep the wolf from the door. Hehe!",
  " The oni have been through a lot to get to where we are today, and look at us now \u2014 living peacefully alongside the humans. Unfortunately, there's still plenty of people out there who've got a bone to pick with us. Hmm? Change? Oh yeah, things are gonna change, alright! You can count on that! But I'll tell you what, it won't involve any sucking up to the humans on my part, nuh-uh! I'm gonna let my actions do the talkin'. They'll come to respect me eventually.",
  " Hey, so I always see you running around everywhere doing this and that for other people, but you're not in it for the Mora, are you? No, you're just straight-up lookin' out for your fellow man. I know a true homie when I see one, and no one appreciates a homies' homie more than yours truly. Put it here, partner! You and I are gonna make a great team, I just know it!",
  " You know what, I gotta admit \u2014 I respect you, always have. I could really see you as a member of the gang, you know \u2014 I mean, you really have what it takes... Whaddya say? I've even come up with a catchy title to tag on after your name, get this: \"The Traveler, 'Second to One'\"! Get it? 'Cause y'know, I'm numero uno, you're my number two, and together we're the most powerful duo in the whole friggin' world, baby! Hahaha! Ah... But, uh, all jokes aside, I know you're on some important journey or whatever. So, go ahead! Get out there and do whatcha wanna do! Just remember, the Arataki Gang will always answer your call.",
  " Ugh, don't even ask. Just the thought of it makes my blood boil! First, the Shogun's Army goes out and steals everyone's precious Visions \u2014 which, already a heinous crime, right? But then... then they go and stick them all over that statue with absolutely no sense of organization whatsoever. I mean, think about it... the more powerful the Vision, the higher up on the statue it should go, that would make sense, right? But nooo, some class-A jerk in the Tenryou Commission thought it'd be funny to put my Vision right at the very bottom! Ugh... Come on!",

  " Question for ya! Do my horns look boring once you get used to them? 'Cause, uh, I was thinking of switching up the style, going for a total overhaul, you know? I'm thinking paint them in rainbow stripes and then strap a few Fireflies on for good measure! Eh, eh? I bet that would turn some heads on the streets... like \"Dude, you're rockin' those sweet rainbow horns, man!\" ...Ah, man, this is totally genius! I'm gonna round up the gang and get them working on it ASAP.",
  " Wanna know the real secret to catching Onikabuto? It's all in the eyeballs. You gotta keep those bad boys squeaky clean at all times, make sure your eyesight's as sharp as a hawk. Trust me, when you're in the middle of a thunderstorm, and the rain's coming down, and the wind's blowing in your face, you gotta watch out, because Lavender Melons and Onikabuto? Well, they can really start to look the same... believe me, I know.",
  " Some of the boys have been telling me that he was the star of the show at the Vision Hunt Ceremony. I'm like \u2014 are you kidding me??? How come he gets his own special ceremony!? Was the hundredth Vision supposed to be, like, stronger than the other ninety-nine, or something? Pff, nah, it can't have been that, 'cause, uh, hello! They would've chosen me if that's what they were going for.",
  " Haha, I only wish I could have met Ayato sooner. He really taught me something. \"You can kindle the warrior spirit even in the weakest of bugs\"... Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time... Yeah, I guess sometimes it takes a warrior to understand a warrior. When we're playing trading card games or battling beetles, we're always totally on the same wavelength.",
  " Hmph, she's always showing off her fancy fireworks and toys to the kids. Well, I'm sick of it! Nobody steals my thunder! I'm the one that's supposed to be adored by the kids! Me! That goes for you too, you're siding with me on this, okay... Huh? Whaddya mean, you're not a kid? Eh, details. If you're shorter than me, you're a kid as far as I'm concerned.",
  " Word on the street is that he blocked the Musou no Hitotachi after you escaped from Tenshukaku. Seriously? 'Cause I mean, that is awesome! Who knows how he pulled it off. Hey, now that I think about it, he's from a fallen clan, and I'm from a fallen clan... That kinda makes us equals, haha! Yeah, so next time someone attacks you, it's my turn to block the blade!",
  " During the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course. 'Cause if she pulls something like that again, this old pain in the neck will be back with a vengeance.",
  " I crushed that Kitsune Ramen eating contest we had. Even all that Fried Tofu couldn't stand in my way \u2014 she didn't come close to beating me! ... I was, uh, bedridden for more than a month after that, but you know what? I'd rather lie in bed a winner than walk away a loser! So... Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!",
  " You know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch \u2014 her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken! Heh, we'll see what she thinks of that.",
  " Oh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit. Also, he gives off this vibe that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, almost as if he understands my innermost feelings... I mean, I've barely met the guy, so that's kinda weird.",
  " Nobody questions my leadership in the gang, what I say goes \u2014 except when it comes to Shinobu. She's always challenging everything I say. And not only that \u2014 all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare.",
  " All I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do \u2014 not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing \u2014 she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too! What's up with that? I mean, a tanuki's what she's going for, right? Sheesh, talk about getting your fur all ruffled over nothing...",
  " I know what you're thinking: \"I don't see it \u2014 how did this guy get to become the boss of the Arataki Gang on the back of beetle fighting and trading card games?\" Well, you're right, those are just child's play. Wanna know the hard skills that really got me where I am? Eating ramen standing upside down, sleeping with my eyes open, playing the harmonica with my nose, and swatting houseflies with my hair. Yeah, I know. Betcha see it now, huh?",
  " People in Inazuma have this ritual every time there's a holiday, or they move, or get sick, or whatever, where they throw beans around and chant: \"Fortune beans are falling down, send the oni out of town. Fortune in, oni out. Fortune in, oni out!\" ...Ugh, the chant gets worse every time I hear it, but the streets full of beans, with my allergies? Total disaster. I've gotta fix this, for every oni out there! We're innocent, people! Quit trying to ward us off and drive us out every time there's a minor life event!",
  " In a... \"attempt\"... to end human prejudice toward the oni, I had the gang use a Kamera to take a picture of me showing my softer side and stick it to the Message Board in Inazuma City. Next thing we know, some jerks have graffitied all over it! Tsk! Then, some ashigaru blockheads from the Tenryou Commission accused me of disrupting the peace, next it was the Yashiro Commission, complaining it ruined the atmosphere in the area, and finally, even the Kanjou Commission got involved \u2014 they sent some lackeys over demanding advertising tax! Ugh, they have no idea who the bad guys are here!",
  " In the Arataki Gang, we're proud to welcome people who've experienced adversity in their lives. Don't listen to the people who call us freaks, or weirdos. Every member of my gang is like family to me, and they all feel the same way. Whatever happens, the gang will face it together \u2014 both the highs and the lows.",
  " I gotta respect the Blue Oni for sacrificing themselves so that the Crimson Oni could live on... In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch! You go to sacrifice yourself, I'll stand right in your way!",
  " Beetle fighting, trading card games, spinning tops, kendama, hide-and-seek, you name it, I can play it! Whaddya say, pick one and we'll have a little contest? Just make sure you're ready to get thrashed! Hahaha!",
  " Granny Oni isn't an oni at all... In fact, she's the kindest human that has ever lived. She only got her nickname because she took me in. If people have got a problem with me, fine, I don't care what other people think anyway... *sigh* But I wish people wouldn't go after her because of me.",

Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Biiiirthday dear Traveler, Happy Birthday to youuuu!",

  " Ah yeah, this is gonna do wonders for my win ratio!",
  " Feel the power, baby! Wanna see me smash a boulder?",
  " I think \"Numero Uno\" just went from nickname to reality, boom! Haha! Hey, but just because I made it to the top doesn't mean I'm gonna forget all the things you've done for me, okay? I've still got your back, anytime, anywhere."

  " Yo, good morning. I'm about to head off, coming with me?",

  " I tend to be a good judge of character. When you've learned to read the open ocean, reading people is a cinch. Haha, and that's how I knew you're the good sort the second I laid eyes on ya!",
  " I chose you as my crewmate, as my comrade on the sea. It gives me great pride to be able to say that.",
  " To those that don't have a Vision, it must seem that those with Visions are like flagships from the Archons to follow. As such, I make sure to fly my flag with pride. That is my motivation.",
  " At a loss? When you don't know what to do, just take the first step. The rest will figure itself out naturally.",

  " One year on the eve of the Lantern Rite, we ran into a storm as we were returning to port. Try as we did, we only made it back to Liyue Harbor in the dead of night, long after the lanterns had all been released. As I looked towards Guyun Stone Forest, I saw an adeptus, floating in the air, in the form of what appeared to be a young boy. I guess it is like the legends say \u2014 there really must be those that watch over Liyue, even if they cannot be seen.",
  " Privately, Ganyu and I get on like a house on fire! But as you know, she's the secretary to the Liyue Qixing... and I'm not exactly in their good books right now! Doesn't bother me, but I wouldn't want to put Ganyu in a difficult position. So just keep what I said between us, yeah?",
  " She's got a great personality, that one! The guys in the crew love that rock and roll of hers. Me? We have common ground, just... not when it comes to taste in music.",
  " Yaoyao always comes on board to play when we're in the harbor. Trouble is, when it's time for her to go she gives you the puppy eyes, and no one has the heart to send her away... Means we're always cutting it quite close by the time we manage to set sail.",
  " Kazuha? That scallywag actually blocked a strike from the Raiden Shogun outside Tenshukaku! Easier said than done... After the battle he came to the Crux Fleet \u2014 said he'd voyage with us a while longer. I was more than happy to oblige. If the day comes when he decides to set off again by himself on the next stage of his journey, I'll send him off with a drink, haha...",

  " You want to know of my legendary tales? Hahaha, that's just my men exaggerating, adding in their own little details. Although, if you were to ask me if I'm afraid of what monsters lurk in the deep, I'd tell you I have no fear of them.",
  " You wanna know why I help the common folk? Why not? Everyone has their low points in life. I don't really do anything, other than help steer those who are truly lost towards a brighter future.",
  " I've been through some hard times. When I was a child we had little money, so nothing to eat, and lived for years by stealing fruit off of people's trees. Even after I got my own ship, I was cast out by pompous merchants. But me telling you such stories is merely for your amusement. I have no intention of making you live through it too.",
  " I have many brothers that sail with me. I have asked, and remember, why each and every one of them came on board. You, however, are special. I know you still have your own things to deal with, and as such, I won't try to rope you into coming onboard permanently. But remember, there is always a place for you onboard The Alcor.",
  " My hobbies...? Lemme think... Well, there's adventure, sailing, making friends, drinking, eating... more than I can count on one hand.",
  " If you can change something, change it. If you can't, don't waste time thinking about it. That's how I go about things. But really, if you get stuck, come find me. I'll help you deal with it.",
  " I like food with robust flavors. Spicy fried meat or spicy tofu are my favorites. Sitting down to a big hearty meal together, where everyone can fill their bellies \u2014 now that's when things get lively! Haha, alright, alright, all this talk is making me hungry!",
  " I'm not a fan of anything cold, it does nothing to fire up my appetite. I'd rather fry up a few fish.",

  " \"Good things come to those who don't wait around!\" That's what they say, anyway. Knowing my luck, the opposite is probably true for me...",

  " Don't stand too close to me, or you might get hit by lightning too.",
  " Weather's not bad today... Oh crud, I jinxed it! Now it's bound to rain.",
  " Careful! In this kind of wind, it's easy to get hit in the head by flying rocks.",

  " You're headed off? Cool. It was awesome adventuring with you. We should totally do it again!",
  " I'm the leader of Benny's Adventure Team - a rising star in the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild! ...Where are the others? Ah, haha, they're all on leave right now.",
  " Eh, it's not as bad as you've heard! Everyone falls into a trapper's pit or gets hit on the head by a falling tree now and then, right?",
  " Hahaha, you wish! Benny's Adventure Team has had no vacancies in ages... I mean, you must be spoiled for choice, right? Why'd you wanna join the unluckiest adventurer alive, anyway?",
  " From now on, I'll distract the monsters and set off the traps while you grab the treasure. Sound good? ...You don't like it? Oh - don't worry about me getting injured! It's what I'm best at... And for you, it would be my pleasure!",
  " I think I get why you teamed up with me now. It's 'cause we're the same, you and I - we both like that adrenaline rush you get from being in dangerous situations. That's what makes adventuring so addictive!",
  " Getting recognized by the gods was the last thing I expected, seeing as how I'm so unlucky all the time. But if the gods haven't given up on me, I guess that means I shouldn't give up on me either.",
  " Do you wanna come and see the view of Mondstadt from above some time? It's real pretty at night, when the city's all lit up and you can see the moon reflected on Cider Lake... Huh? From where? Haha, well, there was this one time when I got picked up by a tornado and ended up on this cliff way up high- Not interested? Oh, okay then, never mind.",
  " I actually quite like cabbage. It's not much to look at, but you can't imagine a world without it. You can grow it anywhere, it goes with everything, and the flavor never gets in the way. I dunno, there's something... nice about being ordinary.",
  " She's the best singer and dancer out there! I always go to watch her in concert after an adventure goes south- it really lifts my mood, chanting along with all the other fans, cheering her on. It's really kinda magical! It's no wonder she's so popular... Boy, if I had even half her popularity as leader of my adventure team...",
  " She's a cute kid... but I have to keep my distance. Whenever she plays with me, her bombs always end up going off... It's not so much me I'm worried about, it would just be awful if something happened to Klee. The Knights of Favonius would never forgive me, that's for sure.",
  " Oh yeah, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung from the world beyond! She's amazing. I keep asking her if we can go adventuring in her home world together, but each time I bring it up she sort of avoids the topic... She's probably just worried about my safety. Her home world sounds like a dangerous place, for sure.",
  " I keep meaning to ask Master Jean for some help with the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild, but I don't know how to go about it. The Guild doesn't have as many rules and regulations as the Knights of Favonius, the dads and I are pretty laid back about everything. Pretty sure that attitude wouldn't fly with Jean though... I guess I should read up on the Knights' etiquette or something?",
  " He's my role model! Talk about team leaders- he's the Grand Master! Leads the whole darn Knights of Favonius! How incredible do you have to be to do that!? Recently, though, I've been thinking that having a smaller Adventure Team isn't such a bad thing after all. I mean, if things got too busy in the team, I'd have no time to look after all my dads in the guild, would I? Yeah... Yeah, things are fine the way they are.",
  " Wolvendom guy! Looks a little on the feral side... doesn't talk much... but he's alright! We both love eating meat, so we got that in common. I sometimes cook some meat for him, and he teaches me how wolves communicate in return. Haha! You should join us next time!",
  " Oh, I know who you mean. The girl who's always charging around all over the place. She's always off adventuring in the wild, just like me... But if you ever see her near a cooking pot, you'll soon find a cloud of thick black smoke blowing in your direction, followed by the smell of burnt steak... Huh, maybe she was born unlucky too?",
  " Noelle's someone I've been watching for a while. She's really talented, and extremely hardworking. But somehow she's still a maid- the Knights of Favonius still haven't made her a knight. It's a shame, don't you think? Boy, if she switched to the Adventurers' Guild, she'd easily be one of the best there is.",
  " Oh... you wanna know about me? Haha, I'm just your average adventurer. 'Cept I'm more unlucky than average. Anyway, I'm nothing compared to you - you're the star of all those legendary tales. What do I got to show for myself?",
  " \"The dads...\" that's how I refer to all the older adventurers in Mondstadt. Apparently, I was an orphan kid that they rescued from the most perilous situation ever. How cool is that? I have such terrible luck all the time, and yet I was rescued against the odds and survived all this time. It's a miracle if you ask me.",
  " You've, uh, noticed then... Heh. Yeah, Benny's Adventure Team has been me on my own for a long time now. Reason is, I have such bad luck that even the most benign of adventures end up turning into the adventure from hell, and no one wants to come with me... Do you feel the same way?",
  " I was born unlucky. That's just the way it is, and I've lived with it so long now that I'm just used to it. But you know what? Maybe it's a good thing. It means I know that whatever luck I do have left is gonna run out sooner rather than later... so I'd better make the most of my life while it lasts. You know, go on plenty of adventures, meet loads of people... I mean, if I didn't live like that, I may never have even met you! Can you imagine? Haha!",
  " Time flies! We've been a team for a while now, haven't we? Anyway, I have a dream I wanna tell you about. Once the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild becomes the biggest branch in Teyvat, I wanna go adventuring all over the whole world! Benny's Adventure Team will be the greatest adventure team there ever was, because you and me are the greatest adventurers! ...\"Since when?\" Uh... I don't remember exactly when you signed onto Benny's Adventure Team. But whatever, it's just details, right?",
  " I like all kinds of things, but most of all, I like adventures! One day I'm gonna find the most valuable treasure in the whole world, and then my dads can have a better life... and the Mondstadt Adventurer's Guild will be back in business!",
  " Hmm... Well, if you really wanna know... When I have a bad day, I feel a bit glum. Like, it sucks when I come back empty-handed from an adventure, or when one of my dads' old injuries start acting up. But they're just small things really, after a good night's sleep I forget all about them. New day, new start! Haha!",
  " Meat! Meat is the best sustenance there is. Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Steaks, and Sweet Madames are all my specialties. You won't go hungry if you come adventuring with me, that's for sure!",
  " You can't really afford to be picky as an adventurer. That said, I can't really handle spicy food. I find it hard to breathe after eating Jueyun Chilis, like the spice went right into my lungs. And there's no avoiding the diarrhea afterward... It's the devil's fruit, I say. Who knows where it came from?",
  " Happy birthday! Best of luck in the year ahead. Don't worry, bad luck isn't contagious! As long as I'm around, it'll be drawn to me and not you, so you're safe.",
  " I feel stronger in every sense! Just as unlucky as ever, though. Hahaha.",
  " I'm catching up with you, Traveler! One step at a time.",
  " Wow, check out all this power! How can I repay you, though? Hmm... Oh yeah! I know this Domain where there's a priceless treasure hidden somewhere inside! Let's go hit it up!",
  " Thanks to your help, I should finally be able to keep everyone safe now. Hopefully, people's opinions of me will start to change. Once the unluckiest guy alive, with a million cuts and bruises to show it, now, a dependable adventurer at long last! Heh...well... I can hope."

  " I take my meals cold to quiet the spirit and calm my vital energies. Qingxin-infused water with ice is the most effective.",
  " \"Heart be pure, evil be erased. Mind be purged, world be...\" Um... Ugh, I always forget that last part.",
  " There is no purer form of water than rain. It can aid us greatly in the purging of evil.",
  " Before the resounding thunder, evil must cower in fear.",
  " Ah, this weather is delightful.",
  " It is unwise to waste the precious morning hours. Time to train!",
  " One's spiritual energies are at their peak at noon. We must take that time to practice.",
  " As the day winds down and the quiet of evening sets in, the atmosphere is ripe for focusing your mind. There is no better time than this for training.",
  " Whew. What a tiring day. You should get some rest. Don't forget what we agreed \u2014 we will investigate that haunted house tomorrow.",
  " We exorcists have been protectors of Liyue since ancient times, and our techniques have been passed down from generation to generation. Purging evil is second nature to us.",
  " *sigh* I didn't actually do anything. I just walked into that haunted house, and the problem was resolved... Do you think I should still take payment for this exorcism?",
  " Your skills are impressive. When you finish with a hilichurl\u2014 I mean, an evil spirit, it is surely banished from this world for good. How about we team up?",
  " By now, you must be well acquainted with Liyue's supernatural phenomena. Now, about the evil beings you speak of in lands beyond... I would very much like to see them too.",
  " Visions are powerful, but one would be foolish to place blind faith in them. Personally, I trust more in thaumaturgy and martial arts. In the end, one cannot become truly proficient without vigorous training.",
  " There are rumors abound concerning evil spirits in Liyue, but not all have truth to them. In fact, some strange commissions wind up having nothing to do with them at all.",
  " I have heard there are many strange and rare things sealed within the amber from Mt. Hulao. Could some of them be the fabled demons of which the ancient legends speak? I would love to investigate.",
  " That Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor seems to be quite an incredible man. Just think, common folk might gang up to commit a murder, we exorcists vanquish demons \u2014 but he alone buries the bodies of the adepti.",
  " I do admire Xingqiu for his devotion to chivalry and his martial arts proficiency. However \u2014 I must warn you that he definitely has a mean side, too. If you find that you fall foul of any of his antics, come to me and we'll form a \"Victims of Xingqiu\" alliance. There is strength in numbers.",
  " The Conqueror of Demons himself has defended Liyue side-by-side with we exorcists for generations, day after day, night after night. I have the utmost respect for Adeptus Xiao. It's just... Why must he be so disparaging toward us? He says our repertoire is lacking and our power is trivial. I'm sorry, but I just can't accept that.",
  " The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is a reputable institution that acts with integrity. But whenever I see that cheeky smile that says, \"It's nothing you exorcists need to worry about,\" it just makes my blood boil... Whoa, deep breaths, Chongyun. Stay calm.",
  " She looks like a zombie, but as an exorcist, I feel there's... something different about her. Hmm, her name is also absent from all the praised names I've seen... Where exactly does she fit in among the deities?",
  " I avoid Xinyan's performances like the plague. That heated atmosphere... Even if you don't intend to get involved, it still... Let's just say that it gets me all hot and bothered.",
  " Xiangling's cooking is universally praised, but I personally don't touch any of her spicy dishes. Why? Oh, you know \u2014 just, uh... personal preference, that's all. I mean, come on, Mushroom Slime Stew... Does that sound appetizing to you?",
  " The elders in my clan have mentioned her before. The fate of her family... *sigh* It's something we can all sympathize with. I originally thought we would be able to bring back a long-lost relative back into our clan. The elders were overjoyed too, when they heard she was alive \u2014 they even prepared gifts for her, and picked an auspicious day for a grand reunion. What we hadn't counted on was that most of the time, she's extremely difficult to track down. Wait a minute, based on our relative positions in the family tree, does that mean I... There's no way I'd have to call her \"Auntie Shenhe\"... right?",
  " Discipline is everything. Unbridled passion can have disastrous consequences. Trust me, I would know. ...Oh, no no no, not from personal experience, of course. Haha... Uh... I'm just stating my observations from what I've seen in my travels around Liyue.",
  " I was born with something called congenital positivity, meaning I have too much positive energy... Apparently it's so rare it only happens once every thousand generations or so. It means I repel all evil for miles around... *sigh* Actually, that's a bad thing. I must be the only exorcist in history who can't get within ten miles of an evil spirit.",
  " One of the main symptoms of congenital positivity is excess passion, something which has gotten me into many embarrassing situations. In an effort to alleviate these symptoms, I have to abstain from eating chilis and all hot food. I also have to take a parasol with me everywhere, and I avoid listening to rousing music. I wonder, will I ever overcome my condition for good?",
  " Waiting for evil to show up at the doorstep will get you nowhere \u2014 you have to go out and hunt it down. By purging Liyue of evil spirits, I bring peace of mind to people and also broaden my horizons. If an evil spirit ever bothers you, just let me know. I'll come and help you out right away.",
  " To permanently banish the forces of evil from the world is my ultimate goal as an exorcist. If that grand day ever comes, I suppose I should be able to consider trying many new things, such as hot springs, Jueyun Chilis, and... partaking in other activities of a more passionate nature. Ugh, what am I doing... Ugh, I shouldn't be dwelling on these things, even thinking about them is too stimulating for me...",
  " I like listening to Tea Master Liu's stories. His narration really brings the hair-raising tales of the supernatural to life. Why not come with me sometime?",
  " After making numerous inquiries and putting in an enormous amount of effort, I finally tracked down the location of an old haunted temple. So I camped out there for four whole days, ready to exorcise the hell out of that place... And nothing happened. Not even the faintest glimpse of an evil spirit. *sigh* Sadly, this is a regular occurrence for me.",

  " Never before have I fathomed such lofty heights of martial prowess! For eye and hand, man and blade to act in unity... Truly, I have been enlightened.",
  " With all the secrets arts that I have learned, my goal of banishing all evil from the world is finally in view. I will never forget how much you have done for me. Maybe now I even have what it takes to face the flames of my positive energy, and see if I can take the heat."

  " Captain Eula Lawrence, Spindrift Knight, Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company. I extend to you my greetings. Huh? What's that...? Yes, Lawrence, the evil aristocrats of historical infamy. Oh, we're still very much evil. Just look at me, I'm infiltrating the inner ranks of the Knights of Favonius, all as part of a diabolical plan to exact our revenge and reclaim our former glory!",
  " Knights and aristocrats share the same cultural heritage, but the knights had enough sense to do away with all the superfluous detail.",
  " You want to learn some Favonius Bladework? Heh, alright then, I'll teach you.... Oh yes, I'll teach you, alright, mark my words...",
  " Aristocratic etiquette is all just for show... Just smile and nod along! I was forced to learn all of the rules by heart, but even I don't take them that seriously.",
  " Quick, under the umbrella, or you'll get soaked! You can't risk catching a cold, because it might turn into something more serious, and if that happens... Well, I can't go avenging my clan by picking on the sick now, can I?",
  " This weather is a hindrance. The thunder drowns out all other sounds, hampering my perception of the surrounding environment.",
  " Visibility is excellent! If we head to higher ground, we can do a full recon of enemy activity in the area.",
  " Rise and shine! The two-hour period before sunrise is the perfect time to strike, because the sentries are getting drowsy towards the end of their long night shift.",
  " Go easy on the grains at lunch and fill up on lean meat instead. If you get drowsy in the afternoon, anyone who's looking for an opportunity to take you down will make their move.",
  " \"May the gentle breeze softly send thee into a sweet sleep.\" ...One of a select few aristocratic pleasantries that's actually quite lovely.",
  " Would you like to hear a lullaby on the bone whistle? It'll send you into a deep and everlasting sleep... Hmm, no. When it comes to my revenge, far more imaginative means of retribution are in order...",
  " The easiest way to destroy your enemy is to take them down from the inside, right? That's why I joined the Knights of Favonius.",
  " Since I'm a genuine Knight of Favonius, I fulfill my duties like any other self-respecting individual would. Look, I may be a descendant of a disgraced ruling elite, but I'm not a total degenerate!",
  " The role of a scout is to hunt down enemy troops, or fend off the enemy in side skirmishes away from the main battle. There aren't a whole lot of rules, which suits my style very well indeed!",
  " Not all customs of the Lawrence Clan are despicable. At least the \"Dance of Sacrifice\" is pure and noble. It puts my mind at ease and gives me comfort. It's been years, but it's still dear to me. My body remembers every step that I... Well anyway, to end this digression, those who wish to master my signature \"Favonius Bladework\" technique have to pass my dance class first.",
  " We're not so different, you and I. We're both outsiders in Mondstadt. Difference is, Mondstadt welcomes you with open arms, but they treat me with hostility and suspicion...",
  " Our feud is for the long term, so rather than get payback on a piecemeal basis, I think I'll make things easier for myself and wait for a day when I can settle the score once and for all. It could be in ten years, could even be twenty... But don't worry, I won't forget. In the meantime, I'll need you to take good care of yourself and have a happy, healthy life, okay?",
  " \"Descendant of a depraved dynasty\" isn't the most flattering reputation to have. The only way I can shake it for good is if I keep avenging my kin in my own way. Those who desire vengeance need power first, so it makes sense that I would get a Vision.",
  " My bone whistle makes a versatile range of sounds, which comes in handy for confusing the enemy. I often use it to imitate the sound of the sea, which is where I get my title of \"Spindrift Knight\" \u2014 this despite the fact that the bone whistle is actually a Liyue tradition.... But then again, no one seems to look too closely into that kind of thing. I'm mean, they took me on, and I'm an exile of Mondstadt trained by an outcast of Liyue...",
  " Technically, aged Dandelion Wine should be poured into a silver goblet and allowed to breathe for 12 minutes, then you're supposed to add ice cubes, ideally so 60% of the ice is submerged beneath the wine. I refuse to do all that though, it's not worth the hassle.",
  " Why do Mist Flowers have to be so rare? The powder they produce works wonders for the bone whistle. It gives it a crisper, clearer sound.",
  " Amber's someone who thinks for herself. On the day I first joined the Knights, she cleaned my dormitory and gave me a tour of the headquarters, and she's helped me with a myriad of other things in the time since. Now, everyone looks at me like the older sibling who needs the younger sibling to do everything for them! Hmph. For this, she must pay!",
  " The Acting Grand Master's family and mine are sworn enemies. But she draws a clear line between professional and personal matters. She saw I was capable, admitted me into the Knights, and gave me lots of opportunities. So, when the time comes for vengeance, I'll afford her a reasonably soft landing.",
  " She's so annoying. She must have read thousands of books... could even be tens of thousands. Meaning, she can effortlessly recall any number of vile tales about the Lawrence Clan's corruption off the top of her head, accurate down to the exact date. Logically speaking, she'd be the perfect person to talk to about someone I'd like to track down, but... swallowing my pride would be too great a challenge.",
  " Everyone loves her. What's her secret? Maybe I could learn a thing or two from her... Hmm, or maybe not. I can't imagine a \"Shining Idol\" would want anything to do with a descendant of a depraved dynasty.",
  " Hmph, the Grand Master... He doesn't like to beat around the bush and has no care for rumors or trivial matters. A good guy, I guess. I sparred with him once, which ended in a tie, but his relaxed expression and leisurely attitude clearly indicated that he had been holding back the whole time... Such indignity! I will not let it go!",
  " I heard that bard sing a few songs about the Lawrence Clan... They were lighthearted and funny stories that mocked the clan in a way I've never heard anyone else do. Even I couldn't help but burst out laughing... And for this, he must pay!",
  " Free from social mores and other people's opinions, and no family obligations... Must be an easy life!",
  " The alchemist... She once gave me a piece of equipment and told me it would help me infiltrate an Abyss Order camp undetected. In reality, it caused a huge explosion that completely blew my cover and before I knew it I was being accosted by 13 mitachurls... Afterwards, I marched straight back there, intending to make her pay for what she had done, but when I saw how panicked and sheepish she looked, and watched her post her results on the wall with the word \"Fail,\" I couldn't bring myself to go through with it... After all, I didn't get hurt, just a little disheveled... and a little humiliated.",
  " I don't get along with some of the knights, and he doesn't think much of them in general, so you'd think that would make us allies. But the way he always acts so aloof \u2014 he's even worse than Acting Grand Master Jean. I want nothing to do with him.",
  " Diona? She's a miracle worker when it comes to making cocktails, and to my surprise, we get along really well. She infiltrated a tavern with the hopes of tearing down the wine industry, while I infiltrated the knights to exact my revenge on them. A kindred spirit it seems...",
  " This one's a long story... We ended up saving her life once when we were tracking down a batch of dangerous cargo that belonged to the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order had packed it up like regular cargo and wanted it shipped from Dornman Port to Liyue Harbor. She was acting as a consultant for the merchant vessel, where she discovered something in the cargo \u2014 and then began to investigate, putting herself in grave danger. Had we arrived just a few minutes later, it's likely she wouldn't have been so fortunate.",
  " We've kept in touch ever since. I like how smart she is. She knows the rules, but she also knows how to be flexible and act according to the situation. A few of the Knights would do well to take a leaf out of her book... Also, with her smarts, maybe she could help me track someone down that I've been looking for... She does owe me a favor from last time, after all.",
  " The life of a Lawrence doesn't include much worth talking about... Basically, whatever you say, whatever you do, people will always despise you and treat you like a potential threat to society. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, though. Before I'd joined the Knights, good grief... I couldn't even buy groceries. Even Good Hunter and Mondstadt General Goods wouldn't take my money. I literally had to go out and hunt my own food and cook it over a campfire if I wanted to eat dinner.",
  " People tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!",
  " The Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status. The reason they invited me to join their ranks is because I'd sparred with some of their crack troops and won through my own sheer skill. Being an insider in the organization will make getting revenge much easier, as it removes many of life's complications, so what's not to love?",
  " The name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history. The Grand Master says that I am performing rather well as a knight, and that if it's not enough to restore the honor of the Lawrence name, it's certainly a strong rebuttal against the one-sided opinions so many people throw around. I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal.",
  " If my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt... I should be the one to end them, along with the Lawrence name itself. For once, it'd be a family obligation I'd actually enjoy. And once the deed was done, I'd be free to pick any name I wanted. Or even let you pick one for me!",
  " I'm into all sorts of cool things. Sipping a nice cold drink, sitting in a canyon feeling the biting wind howl past my face, or diving into the lake at the foot of Dragonspine... Waiting for you to stroll by unsuspectingly, so I can sneak up behind you and drag you down into the icy depths...",
  " Sometimes, when it's busy in the tavern, they ask me to share a table with other customers. But once they find out that I'm a Lawrence, suddenly everyone gets indignant and provocative, and starts trying to bait me out in some way. I just want to have a drink, is that too much to ask!?",
  " I like making my own treats. Not always your typical sweet treats, though. For example, a Chilled Tomato and Aspic Jelly Egg Roll pairs very nicely with an ice-cold glass of Berry & Mint Punch. The most important thing is that they leave the people who like eating them with big smiles on their faces.",
  " I can't stand a rich broth. The flavor is too overpowering, it's so filling you can't train or fight afterward, and also, it doesn't really work as field rations... Simply put, broth and I are sworn enemies!",
  " Today is a day worth observing, though you shouldn't mark your development in age alone. Accept my gift of a bone whistle, and allow me to teach you its secrets. When your day of reckoning comes, see how long you can fend me off with it... It'll make the whole thing much more exciting.",
  " My fighting skills just got a whole lot stronger... But I shouldn't get too conceited just yet. There are some truly formidable knights among our ranks, and I must outperform them immeasurably if I wish to defeat them and avenge my clan!",
  " Good! With this much power, I daresay even the Acting Grand Master herself would be no match for me!",
  " How strange... In the time I've spent with you, my strength seems to have improved exceptionally quickly. I suppose I was rather fortunate to make an enemy of you. I'd better dig my teeth in to make sure you can't get away!",
  " Excellent! The unstoppable power of an immovable glacier dwells within me now and no grand master, acting or otherwise, can stand in my way! There is no time to delay. I must devise my plan, and unleash my attack! Once I have crushed the Knights of Favonius beneath my heel, my next target... is you. Don't try to run. Stand beside me and witness all that must come to pass."

I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, sovereign of the Immernachtreich, do hereby call upon thee to do all within thy power to deliver the traveler from the claws of fate that would seek to snatch them at every turn, and to ready thy mind lest thou be required to make the ultimate sacrifice in the performance of this noblest of duties.Oz: ...You'd place my life in danger so easily, mein Fr\u00e4ulein?",
  " Oh? You inquire about my Edelstein der Dunkelheit? It is a royal heirloom, a ceremonial ornament that displays the majesty of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung before the unworthy. Even here, in this fallen world, I have been reunited with my rightful inheritance as one of royal blood and noble spirit, for the majesty of a true princess shall draw her royal heirlooms unto her wherever so she may roam.",
  " Fischl: If one must reckon time as this world does, I, Fischl, have already seen three thousand winters. Not that the illusory passage of time has any bearing on one such as I, to whom the causality of three thousand universes has been unveiled.Oz: Be that as it may, mein Fr\u00e4ulein. you are not yet considered to be of drinking age in this world, and no bartender can ever be convinced otherwise.",
  " Oz's full name is Ozvaldo von Hrafnavines. Where I hail from, he holds dominion over star and sky across three universes, and the souls of the mighty, fallen in battle, rest in the shadow of his wings. One should add that the penalty for mispronouncing his name is to have one's tongue torn from one's mouth. However, as I am a princess and you are one who has my favor, we are at liberty to simply call him, \"Oz.\"",
  " Fischl: Ah, the ill-starred young man... My Auge der Verurteilung has seen with unmistakable clarity how his heart ails at being forsaken by the world\u2014Oz: Someone needs to keep an eye on the unlucky fellow.",
  " Fischl: The magus-custodian of books, gatekeeper of universal knowledge... Win her trust, and one may yet get access to a vast repository of wisdom.Oz: She means as long as you return your first few library books on time, you'll never have any trouble borrowing a book again.",
  " Fischl: His nature is obscure, his fate a mystery, and his speech a vexing tapestry woven of both fact and fiction... Perhaps he and I share the burden of mystical sight...Oz: Or perhaps he's secretly an actual pirate?",
  " Fischl: Aha, yes, Mona, the mighty astrologer... Mona, who once had the vanity to probe the fate of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung herself! She wound up a trembling wreck, overborne and overmastered.Oz: *whispering* The poor lass was trying desperately not to laugh. It was no easy task.",
  " Fischl: One finds Sister Rosaria to be a most devout believer in the Anemo Archon.Oz: ...\"Devout believer,\" mein Fr\u00e4ulein?Fischl: Indeed! One night, I heard her invoking the name of the Archon thus in another's presence: \"May you be struck down in the name of Lord Bartabos!\" One presumed that she was leading a prayer.",
  " To condemn the guilty, to sanctify the just, and to draw all castaway dreams into the embrace of infinite Immernachtreich. This is the birthright of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, and her burden. None may gainsay it.",
  " My left eye? It is the all-seeing Auge der Verurteilung, which reveals all that is true in the world. As to the question of why I conceal it... Well, would you willingly bear the agony of piercing to the heart of all truths? Furthermore... the world would lose much of its appeal if wholly stripped of delusion and falsehood.",
  " Fischl: Stormterror? Why, one never would have thought that a being that one might have kept as her pet could, in this world, be capable of causing such calamity. *sigh* Pitiable are the incompetents of this world...Oz: That said, mein Fr\u00e4ulein, were you not beside yourself with worry for everyone's safety during said calamity?Fischl: T-That is because the Prinzessin der Verurteilung has the solemn duty to safeguard the souls of all, be they petty beings or not...",
  " Oz: Some people address her by other names. But to me, the one who gave me life and bestowed my powers upon me is Fischl, and none other. All things considered, Fischl is the name that most aptly captures her identity. Seriously, don't call her anything else, or\u2014Fischl: Oh, how one's royal ears do burn! Pray tell, what is the matter which you discuss so furtively?Oz: Mid\u2014Midnight Phantasmagoria, mein Fr\u00e4ulein! And... the majesty of Verurteilung name!",
  " Why must the Prinzessin der Verurteilung punish sin? Because sin defies fate's rightful decree, of course! ...And of course, fate brought you here, so, so... Ahem! It was fate that saw to your descent upon this world, destiny that saw our paths intertwined. I, Fischl, shall always protect you. Because... because fate has revealed to me that this is what has been decreed!",
  " I, Fischl, have roamed the galaxy and traversed countless worlds. I have learned the fate of ten thousand universes and have had revealed unto me the destiny of every living soul.",
  " Oz: Mein Fr\u00e4ulein reads a lot of novels. *sigh* My name, \"Oz,\" is from one of her favorites.",
  " What does it take to rile a princess? ...If you must know, it is those who cannot recognize my true identity. But it is no great loss, for solitude is the noble's lot, so long as I do not lose the nobility of my soul...",
  " Fischl: Hmph! What is food but the shackles of mortal flesh? ...But if the Prinzessin der Verurteilung should reckon any morsel worthy, then it must be the tears of sinners and the tongues of liars.Oz: Has mein Fr\u00e4ulein lost her appetite for the Mitternachtsbrot des Sommernachtgartens?Fischl: ...Uh\u2014 That is merely to provide mine earthly vessel with such sustenance as it doth require to perform its royal duties!",
  " Oz: I believe I know the answer to this one...Fischl: Indeed you do, Oz! Ah, that the poor mortal coil, mutilated by bondage unnatural...Oz: It will never again fly as I do...Fischl: Deprived of the humble coif with which it was born to gaze in awe at the majesty of its monarch... Surely it is a glimpse of my homeworld's hell, in the flesh. Hmm, the name of the dish escapes me...Oz: Something something \"Madame,\" isn't it?",
  " Fischl: Well! If today is truly the anniversary of your birth, it shan't do for me not to mark the occasion. You have my full attention. Speak! Speak to me of your wishes, that which you most desire to fulfill during your fleeting and harsh existence in this wretched world. Whatever that wish may be. Even if, perchance\u2014Oz:  She means, \"Happy Birthday, and if you want, she can\u2014\"Fischl: Silence, Oz.",
  " Fischl: My magic arrow cries out my holy name as it streaks through the night, praying that the violet lightning of retribution shall strike the enemies of fate down from the skies!Oz: Quite awe-inspiring, mein Fr\u00e4ulein! Since it's nearly dinner time, perhaps you might shoot a pigeon down while you're at it?",
  " Fischl: With this,  I may more fully manifest my majesty as Prinzessin der Verurteilung, and defeat that sworn enemy of fate named \"reality.\"Oz: It will also be of use in your work for the Adventurers' Guild, mein Fr\u00e4ulein.",
  " Rejoice! Else, tremble in fear! Whenceforth springs this call to mirth and misery, you ask? Let it be known that I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, sovereign of the Immernachtreich, have peered forth with mine leftmost eye into the tapestry of fate that doth make up the universe, and beheld its every warp, weft and dangling orphaned thread!",
  " I appear to have now regained most of the strength I lost in my transition to this world. Mwuhahaha, the day of judgment is nigh! ...Ah, worry not. Even at the last, when I bring the lightning of retribution upon this world, you shall come to no harm, for thou art blessed by the Prinzessin."

  " Copy that! Here is a draft Service Agreement for your review and consideration. Effective immediately, if all is in order... Ah! Wait a sec, wait a sec, I forgot to sign it... Gan... Yu... There. Right. Now... What was it you needed me to do for you exactly?",
  " It's so nice to de-stress.",
  " If you lie on the grass, you can feel the heartbeat of the world.",
  " Should we really be off work this early? There is still a lot left to do...",
  " Oh good! I was just thinking that the Silk Flowers at the Feiyun Commerce Guild needed watering. The transport co-ordinators will probably moan about the muddy mountain roads again, though...",
  " It is something of a luxury, but I love listening to the rain from the courtyard.",
  " Oh, the sun's out. When did that happen?",
  " Ah, the air is just right.",
  " Ah, I love the smell of Glaze Lilies.",
  " Morning! What's wrong, is there something stuck in my hair? ...Oh. Please don't stare at my h\u2014hairpiece.",
  " Ugh... I need a nap. If there aren't any urgent matters, I'll excuse myself...",
  " Look how brightly lit the city is at night! Amazing. I wonder what it's like for all the people down there... Hmm? Umm... No thanks, I think I'll pass on the night market. Sorry...",
  " May Rex Lapis watch over you. May your dreams be peaceful and sweet.",
  " My job is to honor my contract with Rex Lapis by looking out for the interests of all living things in Liyue.",
  " I finished all my assignments early today. ...O\u2014Overtime? I understand. I'll get right on the case.",
  " I want to understand more about humans... And I especially wish to hear what you think of them. Why, you ask? Because you're... you're a bit different from most people in Teyvat, just as I am... please, tell me what you think.",
  " Um so, yeah, uh, I was, uh... I was wondering what your opinion is on my work so far? Would you say I'm... more of a Common Chest or more of a Luxurious Chest? I\u2014It's fine. I\u2014I can, uh... I can take it.",
  " \"With authority over a thousand comes responsibility to a thousand.\" Rex Lapis knows the meaning of hardship better than anyone else in Liyue \u2014 he has seen everything that has happened from ancient times to the present day, and yet he was forced to give up his entire life. Compared to him, I'm just an everyday Vision holder with everyday responsibilities. I can't complain about my workload.",
  " \"Where merchants flock and all ships dock, and over the oceans flows its stock.\" People say this in praise of Liyue's prosperity. But a city only becomes this successful through everyone playing their part diligently. That's the attitude I take to my work \u2014 I want to be worthy of what we enjoy here.",
  " I've named every single doggie living in Liyue. But they're so funny, some of them still respond even when you call them the completely wrong name. How fascinating is that? Like, if people were to call me \"Bantu,\" how am I supposed to know they're talking to me? No way would I respond.",
  " Qingxin Flower petals are pretty tasty. Incredibly tasty, actually. The only reason I don't plant any at Yujing Terrace is because they taste so good that I worry I wouldn't be able to control myself... Huh? Bitter... Yes, they are... Isn't that what they're supposed to taste like?",
  " I have absolute faith in Rex Lapis. It was only through his leadership that we were able to repel the monsters and subdue the sea creatures, and thus protect the peace of Liyue. The sight of him protecting the masses, and the memory of our centuries of camaraderie... I shall never forget it.",
  " All of Rex Lapis' decisions prioritize the welfare of all life in Liyue. That's what I admire about him the most. I want to live up to the same standard... but it seems that the harder I try to follow in his footsteps, the more overwhelmed I get and the more mistakes I make...",
  " Each Tianquan adds their own interpretation and amendments to the founding laws of Liyue. The current one, Ningguang, does it with unmatched efficiency, but that efficacious manner of hers draws a great deal of criticism. I suppose it is always simpler to criticize than to tolerate.",
  " I cannot stand her disrespectful attitude towards Rex Lapis! But he says to me, \"Ganyu, this is just the kind of person Liyue needs in this day and age.\" I guess I'm not smart enough, because I simply do not understand what he means by that. I think I need more life experience to become wise enough to comprehend his words.",
  " She came to me recently to discuss the reopening of the Bishui trade route. She even asked me what Rex Lapis would do if it were him. Admittedly, what we came up with was not quite on par with what he would have chosen. But... seeing the way she kept starting her plan from scratch over and over again, I think I started to understand her a little bit.",
  " You mean the boy in the blue jacket from the Feiyun Commerce Guild? He's nothing like his father and brother, doesn't seem to care about the textile business at all. Seems it's because as far as he's concerned, there are more important things for him to be doing. Of course, I'm merely speculating...",
  " Xiangling is a celebrity! Um, but... I try to avoid her restaurant. Just... because. No reason. ...Okay, fine. It's not a big secret anyway. It's because you can smell her cooking all the way from the other end of the street. And once you get a whiff, I mean, that's it. You're gone. Next thing you know, you're ordering your second, maybe third round... You just can't control it. Even though I only eat the vegetarian dishes, I don't know what it is. But that is not a road I want to go down again... Not after...",
  " Recently, everyone in Yujing Terrace has been saying nasty things about the Crux Fleet. But in my personal opinion, Beidou's contribution to Liyue Harbor goes far beyond what those miserable rumor-loving heathens could even contemplate! ...Oops! I'm sorry, I... I'm not quite sure how that one slipped out...",
  " Yaoyao... Someone I know at the Ministry of Civil Affairs tasked me with keeping an eye on her in the city, making sure she doesn't try and sneak aboard the Crux... Oh, you want to know what the Ministry of Civil Affairs does? ...Who knows, am I right!? Heh... Who knows what they do? ...Not me...",
  " He seems like a bit of an outsider, socially. Probably just his personality... I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us...",
  " Ah, Yanfei... Even back when she was an innocent little girl, she would tell me that \"you have to keep your promises to live a happy life.\" Now, she's grown up to be a beautiful, graceful, and highly successful young woman. Although the work of a legal adviser is complicated, she always seems so carefree. This puts my mind at ease.",
  " I actually don't know her all that well \u2014 I've only heard bits and pieces from Cloud Retainer. From what I've heard, she can be quite feroicious. Whenever her temper gets the better of her, she is likely to start obliterating her surroundings. I wonder if she's just... bored. Should... Should I recommend some work to keep her occupied?",
  " You have a last-minute job for me? Okay, uh... Sorry, please don't try and explain it all verbally... Write it down, leave a note here. I'll get to it as soon as possible.",
  " Let's see... \"I want to understand Ganyu better...\" Wh\u2014What sort of request is that!? I've never done this before... Um, um, um... Okay... I can ah... run you through my annual review from last year? That should bring you up to speed on me... No good? Oh, okay then...",
  " I've had a long, hard think, and I've realized that so long as it's for a work-related matter, there's really nothing for me to be embarrassed about. So if you really need to understand me more... This, uh, hairpiece... it's actually my horns. That's right. I'm part illuminated beast, qilin to be exact. Okay so, now we've got that out the way... Please sign this non-disclosure agreement for me. And don't tell a soul.",
  " Even though I'm part qilin, I'm still part human too. Still, all these years I've been asking myself the same question: Do I really belong in the human world? Maybe I'm just like a Dendro Slime hiding in the earth, burying myself in numbers and reports in order to escape reality.",
  " Thank you for always making time to chat with me. I feel like I must have spoken more after meeting you than I have in the last ten years put together. If I keep going like this... Maybe one day I'll be able to move on to something other than secretarial work. Now that I've got a few hundred years of experience under my belt, I should be able to avoid any more major mistakes.",
  " My hobby... I would say my job. What? Why don't jobs count as hobbies? I thought hobbies are supposed to be things you look forward to doing, and that make you feel good when you've done them? That describes my job perfectly. So what's the issue?",
  " I don't understand why people insist on going all out to try and prove how their existence is more valuable than everyone else's. To exist in the first place is a beautiful thing, and that's enough... isn't it?",
  " \"Drink only spring water, eat only whole grains,\" that's my motto. So I would be grateful if you could please remove that treacherously enticing-looking plate of delicacies from my field of view. Much obliged!",
  " Qilins are strict vegetarians, so please do not take offense when I decline meat dishes. Yes, that includes your vegetable fritters since they have been fried in animal fat. Thanks, but I can't. I'm afraid I really can't. I don't mean to argue, it's just I have a keen sense of smell, so I know how they've been cooked.",
  " Many happy returns! After all the times you've looked out for me, I didn't even remember to get you a gift \u2014 whoops! Silly me, I... What's that behind my back? Ah. You saw it then. It's a failed attempt at making a Qingxin Flower cake... I wanted it to be perfect, but... Oh, you think it tastes good? Do you really?",
  " Power? ...Now there's a key performance indicator I haven't needed in a long time.",
  " Could we maybe... find a peaceful resolution instead...? Never mind, doesn't matter...",
  " I suppose this is the new way of life, then. I'm not going to complain. I'll try to embrace it.",
  " I remember reading in an ancient text that \"Only when days be darker than the darkest night, may a qilin be compelled to fight.\" That's a massive exaggeration... But should the time come for battle, and should you need me, then I will give it every ounce of my strength."

  " Keep your weapon at the ready. You never know what's around the corner...",
  " The fighting has ceased for now... Commence physical training!",
  " A strong body shows strength and instills confidence in others around you. I must always stay at the top of my game!",
  " Ugh, my tail's getting wet... Let's find a fire and dry off.",
  " Stay alert!",
  " Whew *shivering*... it's cold. These conditions are unsuitable for outdoor maneuvers.",
  " It'd be nice to just lie in the sun... Ahem, but I must set an example for the others.",
  " We can attack downwind and press the advantage. Or, bolster our courage and fight upwind!",
  " The sun is up and it is time to train. Shall we go climb a mountain?",
  " Let's have Radish and Fish Stew with plain rice for lunch today. It's been a favorite among the troops lately, so I suggest you try it, too.",
  " Though the sun is setting, our guard must remain high. We should let our eyes adapt to the dark... Even in the darkness of night, a battle may be looming.",
  " If you're feeling fatigued, then best turn in for the night. I'll take watch! Don't worry, you have my word that everything will still be in good order on your return.",
  " Huh? \"Top Dog Gorou\"? Where did you hear that? *sigh* To be honest, I've grown quite close with my fellow officers, and always share any good news I might have with them. In private, they've all started calling me Top Dog out of respect... But in terms of age, they are all my seniors.",
  " The troops seem to picture me as someone of extraordinary abilities \u2014 I think it might be because of our streak of victories lately. Now they always come to me for advice on even the most trivial matters. When I see the expectant look in their eyes, it's impossible for me to turn them away, but at the same time, my strategic ability is limited... All I can do is give some general pointers, or failing that, respond based on my gut feeling alone. *sigh* I just hope I'm not letting them down.",
  " If there's anything ever troubling you, don't keep it all muzzled up inside. You can always speak your mind with me! Although I can't guarantee that I'll always have an answer, I'll certainly offer you my best advice! Even when I can't muster much of a response, you can always count on me to be a good listener. Whatever it is, I'm all ears.",
  " We train together, eat together, and relax together. There's no better way to strengthen communication and build tacit understanding between everyone on the team. In the heat of battle, just a simple glance can transmit crucial information. Hmm? You don't think it's very appropriate? Huh... Well, I mean, that's how the troops and I have been bonding as a team.",
  " My Vision amplifies my abilities in battle. It allows me to take greater responsibility on the battlefield and forge a way forward for the troops. But I also understand that one person alone, no matter how strong, is never enough to turn the tide of a battle. The key to victory is everyone's united effort, fighting for a common cause.",
  " I don't like to enter battle wearing lots of heavy equipment. I travel light, that's my style. My strength is in moving quickly around the battlefield, seeking out opportunities to take control of the fight. I always target the strongest warriors first to weaken the enemy's morale.",
  " The troops have come up with a nickname for me, the \"ever-victorious pointy-eared general.\" Now there's even a rumor going around saying that \"if you want Top Dog Gorou's victorious luck, give his pointy ears a rub.\" Grrr, there will be no rubbing of my ears, and that's final. If they think they can smile their way into persuading me otherwise, well, they've got another thing... Hmm? Hey, wh\u2014what are you doing? Not you too...? Come on now, I... I thought I... Mm.... Mm...",
  " I've heard that there's a mountain range in Liyue that reaches all the way up into the clouds. Ah, I'd relish a chance to go climbing there!",
  " Captain Beidou values camaraderie, and her exceptional abilities command respect. She once said that she prefers to avoid involving her companions in disputes that don't concern them, which I can completely understand. That's why I only request her help when we have no one else to turn to.",
  " I've seen all kinds of wandering samurai before, and Kazuha is categorically a different breed from the others. He's like a gust of wind that sweeps through the land. Though he never stays for long, he is always able to contribute something to those who are around him. When I fought alongside him, I learned more about what it means to be truly carefree and without constraints. In any case, I think that Kazuha and I make a great team together!",
  " As the leader of Watatsumi Island, Her Excellency is responsible for assessing the scenario and formulating a plan. It is then my duty to put every detail of the plan into action and to keep the situation under control on the front line. We are united with the whole resistance in achieving a single purpose: victory.",
  " I have only the utmost respect for Her Excellency. Without her ingenious and insightful strategies, the resistance could never have come as far as it has today. But if you ask me, it seems that deep down she prefers a much quieter existence. So when there's no pressing military matters, I try not to disturb her too much.",
  " Grr, the Raiden Shogun... I could never bring myself to accept her past actions, no matter what her reasoning may have been. Though a peace treaty has been signed between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, I refuse to let my guard down. If conflict ever breaks out again, I will resume my place back on the front line.",
  " I have nothing good to say about the Shogun's Army, but Kujou Sara is perhaps the most honorable officer among their ranks. We've met each other countless times in battle, emerging both victorious and defeated at different times. *sigh* I know now that it's not realistic to think this way, but I did use to wonder what things would be like if those like her could value the wishes of the people and be free from the grip of the Shogunate.",
  " Oh, her... I'd prefer not to talk about her. Can we change the topic? Or, if there are any tasks I can take off your hand, I'll gladly oblige! Anything at all? ...Ahem, let's just say it'd be best for my general well-being if we can we avoid talking about her...",
  " The Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.",
  " Hmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration \u2014 a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations... However, our intel also indicates that she could be difficult to recruit as she is rather unruly, and often disappears without a trace. Hmm? She's with the Yashiro Commission? Oh, well forget it then.",
  " You mean that sneaky detective that never seems to actually be working on a case? Well, no one from the Shogunate can be fully trusted, so I'll be keeping my eyes and ears on him! On a separate note, he does have some talent for investigation. But how can we know that this isn't all part of some nefarious scheme? Hmm. Only time will tell, I suppose.",
  " Hmm, I'm afraid that most of my days have been spent on the battlefield, so there's not much to tell about me. But if you'd really like to hear my stories, I'm happy to sit down and tell you everything!",
  " I may not have superior cunning or intelligence, but what I do have is my own two hands and my life to lay on the line. Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me. And with that, I've somehow gained enough reputation among our forces to become the leader that I am now.",
  " At first, our only enemies were roaming bandits, pirates, and monsters. But then, everything changed when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree. The Shogun's Army marched up expecting to put us in our place, but we were ready for them, and we hit them hard. Hehe, I bet they never expected to meet such fierce resistance.",
  " Her Excellency once warned me of my fatal flaw... I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?",
  " We are not fighting against any particular group or faction. No, we fight against a destructive malice \u2014 a malice that has trampled the aspirations of the people and destroyed the peaceful lives they once knew. After I rid the land of such evil I will be able to peacefully lay down my weapon. Only then will I trade my uniform for civilian attire... and finally stroll the beautiful landscape of Watatsumi Island together with you.",
  " I love mountain climbing! The steeper, the better. Climbing trains my body and mind, making me stronger with every grip and every foothold. Better yet is climbing mountains with fellow companions. After hours of dirt and sweat scaling the summit, we can sit down and enjoy the view together. It's one of life's greatest joys! Ahem, however, I have absolutely no desire to scale the tallest peak in Inazuma...",
  " There are times when being lightly armored has its shortcomings... For example, I have to be particularly careful of my tail when the enemy attacks with fire.",
  " My favorites are cake and Tricolor Dango, probably because I seldom get the chance to enjoy the luxury of sweets. The rations we have in the field are intended to be simple, effective, and quick, and are seldom served with any seasonings at all, let alone sugar... It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say \u2014 I guess I just have a sweet tooth!",
  " I'll pretty much eat anything, but onions are an exception. One time, the logistics division added ground onion to my food and I bawled in front of everyone, right there at the mess table... *sigh* Talk about embarrassing. The soldiers from logistics felt terrible about it, too.",
  " Today's a momentous occasion, your birthday! Allow me to arrange all the celebrations for you! We can make a bonfire on the beach and catch some fresh fish and crabs. I'll personally prepare a morale-boosting meal that would make even the highest-ranking generals jealous.",
  " With this newfound strength, I will defend those who fight alongside me.",
  " Protecting my soldiers doesn't just mean having a robust defense in place. Sometimes, it means going on the attack!",
  " The key to seizing victory in battle lies in remembering the meaning of battle and employing the right tactics to generate momentum, making your forces unstoppable.",
  " With momentum on our side and close camaraderie, we are unstoppable. Thank you for your guidance. This is a victory that belongs to the both of us."

  " Yun Jin always appears so graceful on formal occassions, but you'd be surprised how friendly she is in private! I made a bet with her once, and the loser had to sing lyrics of the winner's choice in their own singing style. My my, I wish you could have heard her operatic version of the Hilitune!",
  " She is quite the fascinating individual, completely different from anyone else I've encountered. Do you think if I started eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains every single day, I'd be able to look as pure and pristine as she does? Hehe...",

  " If you ask me, there's nothing hard or scary about working at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, it's just a pain is all. It's a shame \u2014 others see us going out to work at night and just don't understand \u2014 and that's what scares them. *sigh* You all just don't understand!",
  " I'm Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's 77th Funeral Director, my grandfather was the 75th. First thing I took over was funeral affairs. Haha, surprising huh? And just like that, it's already been a few years... Time really does go by so quickly.",
  " Balance must be maintained, and yet destinies remain variable. Death has its own rules, and yet is still hard to predict. Remember \u2014 no matter where, no matter when, no matter what the reason \u2014 one should never poke fun at death. Only once you know and respect death can you truly understand the value of life.",

  " Yeah, this is good, thanks!",
  " I never imagined that I, Hu Tao, could ever be like this. Energy like a rushing torrent, a heart soaring like a gliding eagle! I feel great!",
  " If I reach my full physical potential, then the next test is of the heart. It's largely thanks to you that I've been able to step foot into this uncharted territory. It is here that heart and soul are as one like clouds. Death is a constant for all among the multitudes that sit beneath the heavens."

  " Some may see Sister Rosaria as one who complains about how bothersome her work is, but she does her job well. Last time I saw her I told her she could come find me should she ever need help, to which she simply replied that doing so would be even more bothersome. I need to work harder to become of more assistance to the people of Mondstadt.",
  " Master Diluc has his reasons for being so critical of the Knights of Favonius. I am not proud of the way things went, but I cannot change the past. All I can do is keep working hard, in the hope he may one day see us in a better light... This is my duty.",

  " There are leaves around \u2014 and I know just the tune to accompany them, if you wish to hear it.",
  " Wherever in this world I roam, I carry memories of my home... This blade... It is the last link I have to the land of my birth.",
  " Taking a stroll in the middle of a downpour certainly rouses the spirit... but it's best to dry your clothes as soon as possible after the rain stops.",
  " Compared to the storms I've encountered out at sea, this is really quite tame.",
  " I love it when it snows. The world falls completely silent... and I can sleep undisturbed.",
  " Clear weather all around brightens the heart.",
  " The birdsong at daybreak is nature's gift to us. Let us go. Our journey begins anew.",
  " ...The midday sun has a way of making one yearn for a moment of sleep. What say we find ourselves a place to rest?",
  " I gaze up at the moon and lend my ear to the gentle breeze, with wine in my cup and peace in my heart... Have a wonderful evening.",
  " The wind has ceased... The world is silent, so now is the best time to rest well. See you tomorrow.",
  " In truth, not every night out at sea is filled with wind and waves. When the weather is clear, the moonlight flows over the rippling water, and schools of fish circle the ship's hull. At moments like that, when I look out into the distance from the prow, I feel like this journey is worth it... The only thing that takes away from that feeling is the sailors' singing. They're so loud... don't they need to sleep?",
  " The Kaedehara Clan was once a famed samurai clan. It's a pity that by the time the noble name passed to me, the title itself was all that was left. But it is enough for me. A samurai has no need of a lavish life \u2014 we find all that we need in wine, song, and the blade in our hands.",
  " What say you join me out at sea someday when the weather's fine?",
  " I like frank people, because we can freely speak our minds to one another. There is no need to hide anything that you wish to say. I hear the voices of all things in nature, and that includes yours.",
  " As I see it, a Vision is the proof of one's strength, not the source of it. It symbolizes the mortal desire to always keep moving forward, but in this endeavor, we samurai place our faith in our blades alone.",
  " Ah, you'd like to learn the art of the sword? Let me see... Alright \u2014 here, take this. It's a bamboo blade I just made. With these, we can practice sparring without having to worry about getting injured.",
  " \"On this mountain path, where the red leaves lifeless lie... My heart calls for a companion, echoing the deer's cry...\" Hm... I do love maple leaves, but it is a shame that so many goodbyes seem to happen when they turn red.",
  " Farewell, dear gulls, please calm your cries. From this day forth, I am a wanderer once more.",
  " I owe Beidou my life. She took me in when I fled from Inazuma and gave me the courage to return there at the most difficult time of my life. She is a comrade in whom I and all the other sailors can place our trust.",
  " When I was a wanted man, the resistance gave me a lot of help. The time I spent with Gorou was brief, but he left a deep impression on me. He's the type of person who says whatever's on his mind. He shares the highs and lows of his subordinates, and is never afraid to draw his sword for the sake of a friend. That's the kind of person I can really get along with.",
  " She defeated my friend in a duel before the throne, which I accept as proof of her great strength. But she uses that strength to serve as an oppressor's lackey, leading the Kujou Clan's troops to relentlessly seek out and confiscate Visions. This... I cannot forgive.",
  " I see... So she does have her own ideals that she is fighting for. But I have to wonder: can the Kujou family flourish as they did before once this storm has passed?",
  " I've asked myself this question many times since leaving Inazuma. Do I simply resent the Raiden Shogun because of what happened in that duel? Because of the lethal stroke she dealt my dear friend? I've thought about this a good long time, and I believe the answer is no. My friend died an honorable death in that duel, and the Shogun was not unjustified in her conduct. My dissatisfaction with her has its roots in the Vision Hunt Decree. No one has the right to rob another of their hopes and dreams \u2014 not even a god.",
  " I'm sure everyone living in Inazuma has heard of the \"Shirasagi Himegimi.\" The lady of the Kamisato Clan is as perfect as a person can be, though our paths have seldom crossed. I wonder what she thinks of the state of Inazuma today?",
  " The last time she commissioned Captain Beidou to ship fireworks to Liyue, I unloaded the shipment myself. They were so heavy! I doubt that anyone besides her could make such huge fireworks.",
  " During my time with the Resistance, there was no one among our ranks who wouldn't look up to Her Excellency. As someone with a great passion for military matters, victory at all costs isn't really part of her ethos. She'd always try to limit the casualties to the minimum while planning her next move. By some accounts, it also seems that she seeks to take charge of both internal and foreign affairs for Watatsumi Island. Wouldn't that be too much to expect of herself though?",
  " You'd like to know more about me, you say? Well, as you see, I am but a wandering samurai that you could have run into just about anywhere.",
  " I have a very keen sense of hearing. My ears pick up all sorts of sounds: the wind through the mountain passes, the parting clouds, the sound of foxes chewing on apples in the forest, the sound of crabs blowing bubbles... This is nature's favor, it allows me to sense danger long before it draws near.",
  " I used to love the rain when I was small. The sound of it would lull me into a peaceful sleep. But since I've grown older, my feelings have become more... complicated. I still like to listen to the rain today, but whenever I see the storm clouds start to gather, my heart sinks and I can't help but wonder: \"Hm... will some nice person let me stay the night today?\" Listening to the rain in drenched clothes is hardly peaceful \u2014 hehe... nothing can be when you're constantly interrupting yourself by sneezing.",
  " I never stay in a single place for very long. Stagnancy dulls both my connection with nature and the blade I wield. While I am still able to, I want to travel far and wide and meet all sorts of different people.",
  " Don't worry \u2014 even if the day comes for us to go our separate ways, I am certain that we will meet again, in some corner of the world. The fate that brings people together is not a cord so easily cut.",
  " I like falling asleep on a warm rock that's been soaking in the mid-afternoon sun, then waking up and continuing on my journey with no particular aim in mind. So long as I have my blade by my side, there is nowhere I cannot go.",
  " The sounds of nature turn into a clamor of noise during stormy weather. It becomes a constant buzz in my ears. If it happens at night, I end up tossing and turning all night long without getting a wink of sleep. It's quite the headache...",
  " The most easily obtainable food source when you're out at sea is, of course, fish. So it goes without saying that a seafaring adventurer must give careful consideration to how to cook a tasty fish-based meal... If the chance arises, I'd like you to try some of my cooking.",
  " I am not particularly fond of food that is thrown together in a hurry without much care and attention. The way I see it, if your meal consists of a single fish, you should grill it to perfection. Eating is supposed to be an enjoyable experience, so how can we stand to be so slapdash about it?",
  " I heard it was your birthday, so I wrote a haiku for you. Unfortunately, I'm not the most talented in this area, and after trying for several evenings, I was still only able to come up with the first two lines... I guess I'll just share what I've got so far, then. \"Sun and moon rejoice / Birds of dawn sing songs anew\"... Wait, don't say a word, I think the final line is coming to me... Yes, how about.... \"Far from home, with you.\" Anyway, Happy Birthday. Let's go and get you some cake, shall we?",
  " My blade grows keener.",
  " The sound of snow as it lands on the ground is so faint as to be practically nonexistent... But now, my senses are sharper than ever, and I believe I should be able to discern it.",
  " The waves rise high out in the open seas. I, too, must reach new heights of strength.",
  " As one travels the world, sorrows and frustrations are bound to journey with you. But I find that I've grown since meeting you, both in martial arts and in strength of character. I am confident that I will be more at ease in life from this point forth."

  " Still struggling with how Visions work? Let's see... How can I explain it... The apparatus that allows us to see is our eyes. A Vision is the apparatus by which we control the elements. Simple, is it not?",
  " Do you drink wine? Dandelion wine has a unique body to it. Oh, you're underage? You should try Mondstadt's apple cider vinegar. I know just the place.",
  " Have you ever seen the owl of Dragonspine? If you look directly at it, it seems to see right through you, while letting go of none of its own secrets... Quite fascinating, don't you think?",

  " Have you tried one of Diona's drinks? Oh right, you're still underage. Haha, such a shame, it truly is \u2014 to not be able to revel with you in such bliss. Hehe, I guess all we can do is wait for you to be old enough.",
  " Now that you mention him, it is a shame there is no one in the Knights of Favonius to inherit the Grand Master's approach to his work. *sigh* I must say I really do appreciate people like him.",
  " What? You think Fischl having one eye covered is very fitting given her title of Prinzessin der Verurteilung. Hahaha, if that's the case, that must make me a future royal progeny too, no?",
  " I was entrusted by the Acting Grand Master to work in the background to support Noelle, but there hasn't been much for me to concern myself with \u2014 she has a good head on her shoulders. Quite the relief.",
  " Ahaha, you want to know about the secrets of Sister Rosaria? That... I cannot tell you. Though my impression of her is not bad \u2014 certainly better than a certain someone whose name I won't bother to mention. She's honest with herself. She casts off that which she has no time for and she doesn't feign motivation for affairs that do not interest her.",
  " Sucrose may not be much of an extrovert in public, but as they say \u2014 it's always the quiet ones... Apparently, her laboratory is home to quite the eclectic range of implements and her experiments are more than just intellectually stimulating... All hearsay, of course. You don't seriously think I would go snooping around a fair lady's private quarters, do you?",
  " The title of Cavalry Captain is nothing to get excited about. Now that I think about it, the Grand Master took all the cavalry from Mondstadt so there's none left for me to captain... Heh.",
  " There are a total of ten captains within the Knights of Favonius. But truth be told, not all of them have what it takes to be leaders.",
  " My eye? My eye is fine. There's nothing unusual about hiding one's body parts from view. It's the same reason I wear pants... or any other item of clothing, for that matter.",
  " Khaenri'ah, huh? You sure know a lot! The legacy of Khaenri'ah is long gone, the sinners are all that's left, and they're not worth mentioning.",
  " I didn't realize we'd known each other for so long now. Time flies! You know, following you on your journey might just be the most fun I've had in my whole life. I hope it stays that way.",
  " Wine tasting is an art form. Mondstadt's wine is a gift from the Anemo Archon, it's only right that one should learn how to appreciate it.",
  " Lonely? Me? Not with someone here nagging me all the time, that's for sure.",
  " Sparkling wine is a specialty of Mondstadt. Mix it with three parts Dandelion Wine and the bitterness disappears completely. This concoction is known as \"Death After Noon.\" Delectable.",

  " Thoma is a dear friend. He always lifts my spirits with his sunny disposition. In a sense, I think of him as another brother, and as a full member of the Kamisato Clan.",
  " Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission is... not known to smile, and I have had my fair share of disputes with her. She is, however, a loyal servant to Inazuma, there is no question about that.",
  " Mr. Shikanoin belongs to the Tenryou Commission, just like Miss Kujou. He is very... principled, sometimes even more determinedly so than Miss Kujou. The only thing is, when it comes to the question of which matters should be governed by his principles, I believe only Mr. Shikanoin himself knows the answer...",
  " Ah, little Sayu. She hasn't been causing you any trouble lately, has she? Hehe, if you ever notice her slacking off, please let me know.",
  " The Almighty Shogun? It would be improper of me to comment, given that I am one of her subjects. All I will say is that... I think that Her Excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity.",
  " To witness the Musou no Hitotachi and live to tell the tale is quite a remarkable feat. Even though I recognize her as our true deity with the power to change Inazuma's fate at will, if there is conflict between the two of you, then... I shall choose to side with you.",
  " I have always greatly enjoyed working with Guuji Yae. Organizing festival affairs generally takes a lot of effort and doesn't generate much income, but Guuji Yae's events always come off both elegant and profitable.",
  " As the head of the Kamisato Clan, brother always has a full schedule of places he needs to be. I do try my best to share his load, but there is no changing the pressure he is subjected to all year round, and the toll it takes upon him. *sigh* If you see him, remind him to take care of himself, for his sister's sake...",
  " The Yashiro Commission and the shrine maidens are responsible for festival affairs, and Yoimiya, as a fireworks expert, knows how to create an atmosphere. So we have become well acquainted with her over the years. Hmm? Public order and fire prevention? We factor these concerns in well in advance during the planning stage. To deny people the chance to see fireworks simply for these reasons would leave them feeling very disappointed.",
  " Your request is quite unusual for me. Since I see you as a friend, it would only be fair to be open and honest with you, but if this means sharing secrets of the Kamisato Clan... I would ask that you keep anything I tell you in strict confidence.",
  " The Kamisato Clan once suffered a major blow when we failed to protect a swordsmith of national significance. We were harassed by the Fatui, we lost many of our people, and we received a great deal of criticism. It all aged Father greatly, and severely damaged the Kamisato Clan's standing within the Shogunate. Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance.",
  " The art of blade forging taught by the Shogun varies based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes. These differences between smiths is what gave rise to the Raiden Gokaden. Swordsmiths capable of forging renowned blades are seen as spiritual personnel with sacred abilities, and as such they should be managed by the Yashiro Commission, which oversees all cultural, artistic, and ceremonial affairs. So naturally, the swordsmith's betrayal is the fault of ineffectual management by the Kamisato Clan.",
  " My mother was the most incredible person. She was always so dignified and elegant, always smiling, no matter what situation she might be facing. She had so much to deal with in the clan on so many levels, but she took it all in stride \u2014 it was like nothing could ever faze her. Everything about her was perfect, and I say that without exaggerating. *sigh* But the moment she passed away, I realized... I couldn't hide behind my mother any longer. I wasn't little Ayaka any more.",
  " What I want to say next is perhaps not befitting of a member of the Inazuma Shogunate, Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Clan, but... unless I am mistaken, I trust that you will not take issue with this slight departure from convention on my part...That is to say... I'm a little tired, may I rest my head on your shoulder? Just for a moment.",
  " I have great affection for the arts: music, song, poetry, shougi, and dancing. And you?",
  " Troubles? Well, I mean... that's life, isn't it? There will always be things that don't go one's way. But I do not wish to worry those around me on account of things that are my concern alone... so, it is best if I keep them to myself.",
  " Openness is something I find very difficult. I constantly have to remind myself that as a lady of the Kamisato Clan, there are countless people watching and countless expectations to live up to. I must be a model of exemplary conduct at all times. But even so, shouldn't I still follow my dreams? Shouldn't I... share my true feelings with you?",
  " I'm fascinated by food from overseas. Though I don't get to try it very often... So, if I had to choose something from Inazuma, then probably... Chazuke. But not when anybody else is watching... So I tell you that in confidence.",
  " Though I do not eschew animal fat and organs entirely, they are far from my first choice.",
  " Come with me! We're not going far away \u2014 I promise it won't delay you too much. I managed to find out when your birthday was well in advance, so I could prepare in good time. Hopefully this wasn't assuming too much, but I guessed you might prefer this to an expensive gift. In honor of your birthday, please allow me to perform a fan dance for you.",
  " Thank you very much. It has been richly rewarding to learn from you so far, and I believe my skills with the blade can go even further still.",
  " Thank you for your guidance. With your assistance, I am gaining a more thorough understanding of my capabilities.",
  " I feel more competent now than ever before. I even have the time outside my work for the Yashiro Commission to try some new things. Would you like to try one of my home-made snacks? I just learned how to make them recently.",
  " \"Though I cling to that which has given me the strength to hold on, the weight of letting go is ever-foreboding.\" My apologies, it should be a happy occasion, and yet it is such a sad phrase that comes to mind. Our time together has been so pleasant that I am fearful of losing what I have gained. I'm sorry, I must compose myself."

 "Keqing": [
  " I am Keqing, Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. We live in an era of change, as the old order that has existed for a thousand years is about to be rewritten. Join me. Let us bear witness to this historical moment together.",
  " Come on. Enough procrastinating. Let's go.",
  " I'm all for work-life balance, but I think this is pushing it.",
  " In adventuring, as in business, you always have to seize the opportunity while it's there.",
  " Quite a downpour... Nothing will get done until it clears. Let this be a lesson to those who yesterday said, \"I'll do it tomorrow.\"",
  " Thunder and lightning can be quite frightening, but don't worry \u2014 Liyue's storm and fire defenses are second to none.",
  " Don't worry, snowfall on this scale is no impediment. We can keep moving.",
  " Ah, the sun is out, our work's done for the day... Shall we take a stroll?",
  " Morning. Time to set the tone for the rest of the day, so if you're still feeling sleepy, shake it off!",
  " I'm not in the habit of napping at noon, but don't let that stop you if you're feeling tired. I'll give you a wake up call in, say, three minutes' time.",
  " The lights are coming on now that the night is setting in. Another delightful day draws to a close.",
  " Sleep well... me? Uh... I still have a handful of things on my to-do list, but I'll call it a night once they are done.",
  " If you feel strongly about something, you should speak up and take action. That's the philosophy I live by.",
  " My role is to manage real estate and construction in Liyue. Sure, Liyue is a vast place with abundant resources \u2014 but without proper planning, and if too much focus is placed on short-term profit, a great many things can go wrong.",
  " What do you think has kept Liyue going over the last millennium? Rex Lapis? ...I disagree. We mortals have to fight for survival whatever happens, he just feels the need to come down here and poke his nose into everything that's going on for some reason... Hmph, people don't like to think about this, but should we really be trusting him to be an expert in everything?",
  " After I took on the management of so many of Liyue's affairs, I had a new-found respect for Rex Lapis and all his hard work over the last millennium. Recently, every time I come up against a difficult problem with no obvious solution, I find myself thinking: What would Rex Lapis do? Maybe he really IS an expert in everything, and I've got more left to learn than I realized...",
  " You know why I like you? It's because you don't believe something just because it was said by a god. You make up your own mind. You ask the questions everyone else is too cowardly to ask, and when you don't get an answer, you keep looking until you find one. Oh, don't worry \u2014 your way is definitely the right way. Who says gods don't make mistakes, anyway?",
  " It's not difficult, you'll see, just give it a try. What if you try and it doesn't work out? ...No, I don't believe that will happen. You've never let me down before, you don't seem the type.",
  " I used to be so naive. I genuinely believed that I was on a par with Rex Lapis... Seems I really overestimated myself. Hmm? Yes... You're right! I have plenty of self-confidence in other areas, so why not in this? ...I can catch up with him \u2014 I WILL catch up with him! I just need to keep my chin up, keep trying, and keep learning!",
  " If a Vision means the approval of the gods, then I don't see why I should want one. In fact, I find it quite insulting... It's like trying to say everything I've ever achieved is all thanks to the gods looking out for me! Well, I got to where I am today through hard work. The gods had nothing to do with it.",
  " Oh, so... Rex Lapis wanted me to have power beyond the average mortal so that I can be a great leader? Huh... I like to think I'd do an admirable job even without his blessing! Yeah, I'll show him... I won't give him any reason to be disappointed with me...",
  " In addition to my work with the Liyue Qixing, I do a lot of work for the public, too. Mostly the feedback is positive, but whenever I propose something like adding an extra hour to the workday, I come up against very strong resistance... I'm too forward-thinking, I suppose. Maybe I should start with a half hour instead?",
  " What do you mean, Geo Archon paraphernalia? ...You're not suggesting my bedroom is full of that stuff, surely? I'm not a child anymore! Although... Okay I did buy a couple of Rex Lapis figurines recently, but \u2014 but, they're just to keep me on the straight and narrow. Look, just because I own an idol or two does not mean that I idolize him, okay!?",
  " I once heard a Mondstadt fable about courage being what it takes for birds to learn to fly. But I think that you must first possess a yearning for the boundless skies before you would have any inclination, let alone the courage, to spread your wings and try to fly. For me, Liyue is that boundless sky.",
  " The gentleman from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? Clearly, he's an extremely learned individual, and I do have a lot of respect for him. But his mindset is too traditional for me \u2014 he thinks in the same tired old terms as Rex Lapis did.. If he were more of an original thinker, I'm sure he'd be a great asset to me in reaching my objectives.",
  " That captain is always flouting the rules, and her personality really rubs people the wrong way. That said, The Crux Fleet is indispensable to Liyue Harbor. It's a bit of an art, knowing when to enforce the rules and when it's in everyone's interests to be more lenient. Thing is, the Tianquan is supposed to be the one enforcing the rules, but she always seems to be too busy...",
  " We do work together, but we couldn't be more opposite personality-wise. To her, Liyue Harbor is nothing more than a marketplace, and she'll do anything as long as it makes money for her. Doesn't she have any principles? Hmm, or maybe turning a profit is her principle?",
  " Since Rex Lapis left us, we've actually found some common ground. I was quite judgmental of her in the past, and we still fundamentally disagree on a number of issues, but in the current climate I have to say I count her as a comrade in arms.",
  " Ugh, having said that... I ordered a Lucent Crescent from Mingxing Jewellery three months in advance, and when it was finally time to pick it up, they told me Ningguang had bought up the last few months' worth of Lucent Crescents for herself by paying double the price! *sigh* She can be such a pain!",
  " You know what, I think her music rocks. Too noisy by traditional standards, for sure, but I don't care. Good music is good music. And good music should reach the widest possible audience.",
  " Everyone has faith in Dr. Baizhu's medical skills. He's the right guy to go to when you can't figure out what's wrong with you. Oh... the rumors, you say? The only one I know for a fact is true is how disgusting his medicine tastes. It's not just the kids who find it bitter, it's left me with some horrible memories, too!",
  " Yeah, the up-and-coming chef from Wanmin Restaurant... I get that she's gifted and everything, I just think her cooking can be a bit hit-or-miss. I was all ready to hire her for a small banquet once, and give her full control over the menu... but the amount of lizard and slime in her sample dishes quickly turned me off to that idea!",
  " I've heard his story \u2014 he was born into a well-to-do family, but wasn't keen on the family business, so he now devotes his time to being an envoy of justice. I have huge respect for that! Not everyone has the guts to follow their dreams when it means breaking with a long-standing family tradition.",
  " I feel like now that we live in the age of mankind's rule, it's time for the legendary boy-adeptus to be released from duty. We no longer need a defender of that kind, because we are capable of working through the challenges we face on our own strength.",
  " Who knows what Rex Lapis must have done to inspire such blind devotion from Ganyu... But her reluctance to be critical is not without its advantages. In the workplace, she'll carry out my instructions to the letter, even when I can tell she has her reservations. It's a good attitude to have as a career professional.",
  " I find myself getting a second opinion from her a lot these days. Lots of things come up that I just have no idea about, and of everyone in Liyue, she's probably the most familiar with Rex Lapis. Heh... I feel a bit awkward, though, because I used to be openly disparaging of Rex Lapis in front of her... But she doesn't seem to mind, so I guess I've got nothing to worry about...",
  " When you're passing by Heyu Tea House and have to squeeze your way through the biggest crowd you've seen in your life, that's when you know Yun Jin's on stage performing. There's not a merchant in Liyue who wouldn't buy up the place if they had the chance, and Yun Jin is the reason it would be worth every Mora.",
  " Since Rex Lapis left us, the question of Liyue's future has been on my mind constantly. In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too. Mondstadt's god is the one who baffles me the most though \u2014 how exactly do any of his actions contribute to the longevity of Mondstadt? It's completely beyond me.",
  " The way I see it, the law is a summary of things done the right way in the past. However, it should also be continuously adapted and improved to match the needs of the present. Given that Liyue is about to undergo a radical transformation, legal talent is in great demand. With an assistant like Yanfei, I could spare myself a great deal of trouble.",
  " You want to know more about me? Sure. Let's start with the principles that are central to the role of Yuheng. Once you've memorized the hundred or more contractual obligations of the position, you'll know my hopes and dreams like the back of your hand!",
  " Nothing exists independently, and there's nothing you can do to change that. So, when you drag your heels on one thing, you're actually causing chaos for a whole bunch of other connected issues, too. That's why I firmly believe you should never put off until tomorrow what you can do today... I'm also a very impatient person and can't stand procrastinating, so that's also a part of it.",
  " Never mince your words with me, okay? Yuheng's just a title. I'll not have you treading on eggshells around me just because of my status. Say what's on your mind, always \u2014 that's what makes you unique, and it's the thing I admire most about you.",
  " We've been on our fair share of adventures together, haven't we? The more time we spend together, the more I think you're the person of my dreams, and\u2014 Huh? Why so shocked? You're a crucial part of my dreams for the new Liyue.",
  " \"The time has come for humanity to make its mark in the land of the Geo Archon...\" Turns out that was quite an ambitious statement after all. But I want you to make me a promise: come and visit when the new Liyue Harbor is born, I will show you around. After all the help and support you've given me along the way, you deserve to see Liyue reborn with your own eyes. I owe you that much.",
  " That indulgent feeling of being spoilt for choice between countless different varieties... That, to me, is the appeal of shopping.",
  " It's great that the quality of life in Liyue is improving for everyone. But one downside is the growing number of people who are happy to reap the rewards without doing their fair share of the work. The Liyue Qixing did not put in all this effort to create a more prosperous society just so people like them can loaf around.",
  " It makes no logical sense to be greedy with food, but for me, all rationality goes out the window when there's Golden Shrimp Balls involved... They're just irresistible. The taste of a single Golden Shrimp Ball brings me so much joy that all the stress of work just melts away.",
  " Everything has a certain way it should taste. I won't touch anything that tries to break the mold, so no salted Almond Tofu for me, and no sweetened Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup either. It's just a total waste of perfectly good ingredients.",
  " Happy Birthday! I've got a very special gift for you. It might look like an ordinary old lantern, but this one runs on Electro energy and stays alight for a really long time. For those times when you need a little extra light in your life.",
  " When your heart is set on something, you get closer to your goal with each passing day.",
  " Great, having another trick up my sleeve gives me more flexibility in rapidly changing circumstances.",
  " Yesterday's experiences make me stronger today. And most of those experiences are ones that I share with you.",
  " I feel I have grown immensely from my travels with you. If, one day, I finally manage to make my dreams a reality... I wonder, will you still be there by my side?"

  " Do you wanna come fish blasting with me? I'll get grounded for a whole day, but it's way worth it coz the fish taste sooo goood!",
  " \"Explosion inside city wall, grounded be thy woe,\" \"Explosions can hurt people, Jean can be dreadful,\" \"Mondstadt be bombed, Klee be doomed.\" Those're the survival rules that the Knights of Favonius gave me.",
  " Mwauhahaha, lucky all my new bombs are waterproof!",
  " What'd I blow up!? ...Oh wait, it's just thunder and lightning. Phew.",
  " Dear Anemo God, please make Klee's bombs blow in the right direction and only blow up bad guys. The end.",
  " Good morning! Can I come play with you today? Pleeeease? I wanna go on an adventure!",
  " Lunchtime! What do you wanna eat today? Let me see if the Teyvat Travel Guide has any suggestions...",
  " Good evening! Can you please tell Huffman that Klee is not a baby and is definitely allowed out to play at night? Please take me out to play together!",
  " Hey... Um... I know I said I don't wanna go home and all, but now it's nighttime and I can't find my way home in the dark...Can you please take me home on your way back? Pleeeease?",
  " Ohhhhh... I broke one of the blades on the windmill - I'm really sorry!",
  " I'm really good at fixing things though. I can help! Huh? What do you mean that's child labor? What even is child labor? Does that mean I can't help?",
  " Hee-hee, you're an Honorary Knight but I've been a Spark Knight longer... That means I'm higher up than you, right? So you have to do what I say! So, um... Ca-Can you not say anything about the big disaster I caused? It was an accident...",
  " No! It's only nine o'clock, I'm staying up to watch the circus' special midnight performance! You're supposed to be my best friend! Don't even think about trying to send me home!",
  " This little marble is supposed to be a present from Barbatos to say well done? Well done for what though? ...Hmm, he is the god of freedom I guess, maybe that's why he likes me? Alright, from now on I'll say thank you to Barbatos by showing that I have the freedom to blow up as many fish as I want! ...Am I doing it right?",
  " At the Knights of Favonius building, you're not allowed to blow up the walls. Shame, it would make getting out of solitary confinement way easier... but if I did so much as try to blow up the wall, Jean would make sure Klee never sees the light of day again. That's what Jean said, Kaeya told me.",
  " Every lizard has a different pattern on his back, and some of them you can use their dried-out tails to make gunpowder with. I know because Albedo told me so.",
  " Razor's one of my best buddies! Whenever a disaster happens, he always knows the best way to fix it and helps keep Klee safe. Um, but most of the time I'm the one who caused the disaster...",
  " My mom and dad are the famousest travelers in Teyvat! Mom writes the Teyvat Travel Guide, so all the restaurants and hotels in the whole world care what she thinks about them.",
  " Kaeya is the best! He wrote the Favonius Survival Rulebook for me and he always helps me cover it up when I make a big disaster.",
  " Amber is the best! Baron Bunny is so fluffy and he even explodes! So. Cool.",
  " Master Jean is the best! But she's also a little bit scary.",
  " He's one of the weird grown-ups. He's so grumpy all the time... Why does he never smile?",
  " Lisa is the best! She always sneaks me some treats when I visit her at the workshop. ...Huh, I just remembered I was gonna ask her if I could use the workshop to make some new gunpowder. But I totally forgot...",
  " Bennett is the best! I always find way more treasure if I go adventuring with Bennett! ...But he never finds any. Why is that, anyway?",
  " Diona is the best! I like listening to her, last time I heard her say, \"I'm gonna destroy the wine industry in this city if it's the last thing I do!\" And I'm gonna help her using my bombs! ...I don't know what a wine industry is though. Is it a monster?",
  " Me and Albedo have a secret code! Whenever he puts a sign on his workshop door saying \"Experiment in Progress,\" that's code for \"Come back later, Klee.\" Albedo's really nice and he's so patient with me, so I don't mind waiting until he's finished with his work.",
  " Mona is the best! It's so much fun when she comes to play with me and Albedo. She talks about all these amazing things, and I don't understand most of it but... Ah, I just love it when Mona comes round!",
  " Sucrose is the best! This one time she asked me if I wanted a Jumpy Dumpty that can run as well as jump. Tee-hee, well duh! Of course I do, I want hundreds of them! I wanna put them on every street, every staircase, and every square in Mondstadt!",
  " Hello, are you here for playtime with Klee?",
  " Yeah! This is my new and improved bomb! Whaddya think? Great huh? ...Oh, but ahh... If you find it near any fires, it's not mine. Definitely. Not. Mine.",
  " Sure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas... But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place.",
  " This is Dodoco, my oldest and bestest friend! Okay, now I've introduced you, don't forget her name again alright? No more calling Dodoco (puts on silly voice) \"that silly doll Klee always hangs on her rucksack.\"",
  " Thanks for helping me out every time I get in trouble! I have a thank-you present for you \u2014 barbecued fish, made with my own secret recipe! ...Okay, so the secret recipe is exploding the fish out of the water. Tee-hee, they're fully cooked by the time they land! But it's a secret, right, so you don't get to tell anybody. Just pretend like you don't even know.",
  " I like things that are fluffy~! Like Dodoco! And dandelions! And Razor's hair!",
  " *sigh* You're a good person, but I'm a bad girl. Once I'm out of solitary confinement and am done reflecting on my actions, we can go play together again, okay?",
  " Mondstadt's basses are delicious, especially the ones you grab yourself from Cider Lake! I'm not even kidding, even my mom thinks so.",
  " I hate, hate, hate Mondstadt's crabs! All of them! I wanna go out and play, I don't wanna just sit there tryna de-shell a crab all day...",
  " \u266aHappy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear traveler, happy birthday to you!\u266a You're older than me right? That means you've had way more birthdays than me... I'm sooo jealous!",
  " Mm, new-bomb research complete! Now, let's get outta here before Jean finds out...",
  " Aw yeah, I improved again! But as Jean says, \"Continuous self-improvement is one's duty.\" She says that means I'm allowed to be a bit happy about it, but not the most happy I've ever been in my whole life about it.",
  " Thanks for helping me gather so much stuff for my research! If you ever wanna learn how to make a bomb, I can teach you y'know.",
  " I remember the first time I ever heard an explosion... I wasn't scared at all. Later on, I found out that apparently, that's not \"normal\", and most people would've been scared. But hey, you're not scared of my bombs right? Tee-hee, I knew it! That's why you're my bestest friend ever!"

  " I am Kujou Sara. You may forget my name, but this you must know: On my watch, Inazuma will always be defended, and the will of the Shogun will always be done. Deity or demon, if you make an enemy of me you will be struck down! Oh, ahem... Don't be so nervous. I have agreed to fight by your side, and I will honor that commitment. I may be uncompromising on matters of great importance, but on most other things, you will find me quite easygoing.",
  " The sound of rain masks the enemy's footsteps. Stay alert.",
  " Listen. Thunder speaks the will of the Almighty Shogun.",
  " I would like to catch a snowflake, but once you have them in the palm of your hand, they melt away all the more quickly.",
  " The skies are clear and the sun is bright. Fine weather for a showdown.",

  " I am not in the habit of resting at noon. But if you wish to do so, I will wait for you.",
  " Good evening. You know, in Hanamizaka, the sight of the Sakura by night is quite splendid. I never tire of it.",
  " Go and rest. I will stay here and keep watch.",
  " I am grateful to Takayuki. The Tenryou Commission is all I've ever had to rely on, and I will do everything within my power to defend my family's honor. Hmm? You want to know about the Tenryou Commission's code of conduct? Loyalty to the Raiden Shogun, of course! That is also my life's creed.",
  " Am I ready to depart? Let me put it to you like this. If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10. The other nine times, I would already be fighting fiercely on the front line. Not because I am foolhardy, nor because I lack courtesy, but because the battle never waits till you are ready.",
  " My aspirations? I thought you already knew: To assist the Almighty Shogun in manifesting Eternity. That is what I aspire to. Hmm? Personal aspirations? It's not something I have ever thought about before...",
  " Though you present an unstable factor in the Almighty Shogun's Eternity, unstable does not have to mean a threat. So I am not your enemy \u2014 but I will be watching you at all times.",
  " When I confiscated people's Visions, I trampled on their ambitions. Now that the Vision Hunt Decree has been repealed, I must atone for my actions. I am led to believe that you can hear those ambitions...The ones echoing within the Visions embedded on the Statue of the Omnipresent God? I'd like you to tell me more about them. Also... your own ambitions, I would like to hear about those as well.",
  " Only if the gods cast their gaze upon you will you receive a Vision. Since my own Vision was granted by the Almighty Shogun, I shall return it to her in the end, without hesitation and with no regrets.",

If he ever tires of working for the Kamisato Clan, I would very much like for him to come to us... though I doubt that day will ever come.",
  " In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there.",
  " As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know \u2014 all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma.",
  " Shikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him. He seems preoccupied with his personal schemes while official duties take second place. The only reason I have not sought to bring him into line so far is that his investigations deliver results...*sigh* He is such a headache.",
  " As I'm sure you've heard many times before, the Almighty Shogun seeks Eternity \u2014 an existence beyond the dominion of thought and longing. \"Abandon mortal ties, strive for an unchanging Eternity\"... The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her.",
  " So, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route. I do not know whether the Shogun has finally found inner peace after protecting Inazuma over all these millennia. All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done.",
  " Guuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance.",
  " She is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the Shogun's Army? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not.",
  " Gorou is to Sangonomiya Kokomi as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better.",
  " Tsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself.",
  " You want to know more about me? ...Know what, exactly? I can't discuss Tenryou Commission business with you, that's strictly confidential, and I certainly can't divulge anything relating to the Almighty Shogun. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Hmm? Me on a personal level...? I suppose that's not out of the question, just... unprecedented.",
  " I lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot. Then I go to the courtyard where I take five deep breaths before walking five laps around it. For breakfast, I typically eat five mouthfuls... Five is my lucky number, so I do things in fives. Do you have some objection to that?",
  " The thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained. The will of the Almighty Shogun must be executed, but I do not condone violence against innocent people! I have expressly forbidden such behavior on countless occasions but judging by the outcome, it seems difficult to root out. If you have any ideas on how to tackle it, please share them with me.",
  " Although I was fully adopted by the Kujou Clan, I know that Takayuki does not look at me the same way he looks at Kamaji. I might be a little stone-faced sometimes, but even I get lonely... especially when I catch sight of one of my subordinates sharing an intimate moment with their family. ...I'm sorry, I have nothing but gratitude for Takayuki. How could I be so disrespectful...",
  " Now that I think about it, you and I are a good example of achieving concord through conflict. We were on opposite sides \u2014 diametrically opposed, you could say. I never imagined I would end up alongside you, either in battle or in long conversation... Fate has been kind to me, no, sorry, ignore that.",
  " To this day, not a day goes by without bow exercises and target practice. From adopting the stance, to aiming, to hearing the twang of the bowstring, none of this is dry and repetitive for me \u2014 it is about transcending the me of yesterday! I wouldn't call it a hobby so much as a lifelong discipline.",
  " The existence of a tengu warrior's wings is an objective fact, as is the reality that they will take up a certain amount of space when standing side-by-side. So when you say \"come closer,\" I fail to see how exactly I am supposed to achieve that.",
  " I have always had a preference for easy-to-carry foods that provide quick and ample sustenance, such as Onigiri. The top choice for replenishing your stamina in the middle of a battle! But that's just a personal preference. I don't dictate what my subordinates have to eat.",
  " I generally avoid sweet foods, not that I have a strong aversion to them. Why? Well, sweet things put your mind and body at rest, so if I ever eat sweet things it's easy to... Ahem, essentially, I mustn't slack off and that's the end of it. No further questions on this topic!",
  " Excellent timing. I will dispense with the formalities and get straight to the point \u2014 do you have a birthday wish? Providing that it does not conflict with the Almighty Shogun's grand cause, I will make every effort to see it come to fruition. To show that I am being completely serious, I will allow you to make not one, but five birthday wishes.",
  " My bow sounds in peak condition. One shot is all I need.",
  " Power duly assimilated. Ready to receive instruction.",
  " The Shogun's Army might as well just be me!",
  " The responsibility for honing my strength and advancing my martial abilities lies with me, and yet you have so diligently and willingly helped me... I will become worthy of this power by harnessing it for a higher cause! Also... the favor of the tengu will always be with you!"

  " What's that? You want to learn some Sumeru Academia magic? I'm afraid it might too much for you to handle right now... Hmm, though I suppose it can't hurt to teach you some of the basics. Here, start by reading the beginner's guide, it's only 800 pages or so.",

  " Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them.",
  " Fate is called as such, for it cannot be changed, nor can it be reversed. It can only but be accepted.",
  " With rain this heavy, not only are the stars clouded, so too is my scryglass hazy.",

  " It's already so late, and I'm no further along on finishing tomorrow's astrology column. What? You're off to sleep? *sigh* I wish I could sleep now too...",
  " The work of the astrologer is to show people what fate has in store for them, and that's exactly what I do. There will always be those however, who are unable to accept what they are told.",
  " Why do I write reports, rather than using my divination to earn Mora? I would never use hydromancy for the sake of Mora, nor did I learn hydromancy for that purpose.",
  " I don't know. Unless left with no other choice, astrologers do not foretell their own fate. The elders of my art warned against it, for it can turn fate in on itself, which is incredibly dangerous.",
  " As you are not from this world, I am unable to give you a prediction. All I can tell you is that your journey is far from over.",
  " When I first received my Vision, the elderly woman that gave it to me, she put on this air and said \"May your heart of truth be with you.\" And yet this thing does nothing for my hydromancy, all it does is get me wet.",
  " That said, a Vision doesn't hurt to have as a little accessory. It is, after all, the one useful study tool that miserly old lady ever gave me, in a rare act of generosity.",
  " Do you know about constellations? Astrologers believe that the patterns of the stars map out the destinies of Vision bearers \u2014 past, present, and future, everything is written in the stars.",
  " This... travel companion of yours \u2014 do you know anything of her origins? No matter what, I cannot seem to discern a single shred of information regarding this floating fairy's fate. ...Oh? So you don't know where she comes from, either?",
  " You mean the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius? Her constellation is Leo Minor, which represents strength and responsibility shouldered too young... Though the lioness has been separated from her pride for a long time, she grows from strength to strength, and the day will come when she is ready to return as its glorious leader.",
  " Albedo? Ah... I envy his ability to solely focus on his research without getting bogged down in mundane worldly affairs. What a wonderful life! If that batty old lady hadn't had one too many screws loose, perhaps that's the life I'd be living by now myself...",
  " Ah yes, Alice's daughter. She's in the custody of the Knights of Favonius, and Albedo looks after her too. She's blessed to have Trifolium as her constellation, which represents good luck. I'm slightly envious... *smirk*\nAlthough, if I'd been blessed with good luck, I suppose I never would have had the great honor of running into that old woman, would I...",
  " Diluc Ragnvindr. His constellation, Noctua, represents vigilance in the darkness of night... A lone guardian keeping watch, longing for the splendor of dawn, yet destined to solitude in the dark days preceding its arrival.\n...Or, wait, maybe Noctua's the one tied to wealth...?",
  " Kaeya Alberich? He's a Pavo Ocellus. Destined for greatness and grandeur... and to hide ugly realities behind a layer of charm and elegance. He believes he has made a clean break with his past, but one day fate will catch up with him. When it does, he will have a major decision to make.",
  " A Tempus Fugit... The constellation derives its name from the hourglass, and stands for knowledge and time \u2014 or rather, the trade-off between them. As each grain of sand falls down, a moment of time \u2014 of life, even, dies for good. To stop the unrelenting flow of sand, one would have to turn the hourglass on its side. But once the sand comes to rest, it remains motionless forever... Hmm, maybe 'becomes lazy' is more accurate than 'comes to rest,' in this case.",

I can't see a thing... this wind... I can't... open my eyes! No, my hat! Ah! My clothes, stop! The wind's going to strip all my clothes off! Make it stop, make it stop! ...Alright, alright! I'll never do this again!",
  " You want to chat... for fun? Oh... I don't usually have spare time for such activities, especially when I have so many columns left to write... Then again, since it's you, it might be worth it. Hehe, a change of pace once in a while isn't such a bad thing.",
  " Income? From astrology...? You can't use... things like Mora to determine the value of astrology! You need to understand: hydromancy is the one and only means of discerning people's true destiny in the whole of Teyvat! No matter how much Mora or gems you might have, the value of fate is quite incalculable! Perhaps not the smartest question you might have had for me...",
  " You want me to explain how astrology works? I'm not sure you'd understand even if I told you. But since you ask... The method I use is called hydromancy. The art of inferring fate from the illusory reflection of the stars on the water's surface. The inverted reflection in the water is an image of the heavens from within which the truth of our world can be observed. ...It is the one and only success story of that old lady's research endeavors.",
  " Mona Megistus, the Astrologist \u2014 we came up with that name together, the old lady and me. She said it had a nice ring to it...

Gah! I knew I shouldn't have told you!",
  " The golden rule all fortune tellers abide is: never offer advice. Only state the results of the divination. Otherwise, you risk your fate becoming tangled up with that of your subject. But for you, I will make an exception to this rule \u2014 because our fates have been intertwined from the beginning.",
  " My hobby? Stargazing! In this all-too-real world in which we live, we all need to look up from the dust once in a while and fix our gaze on the stars, in a spirit of wonder... that, plus the whole thing about me being an astrologer.",

Hmm, which one to prioritize? ...Ah, I'll pay off the celestial globe first, if I leave it any longer they'll sell out and then I'll never get my hands on one...",

  " You know, all those... overpriced, fancy foods. Personally, I think it's uncivilized and, frankly, dangerous to splash out and indulge yourself every time you have a little hunger pang.",
  " Happy Birthday. Here's my gift to you \u2014 it's a bag containing some words of advice that may help you through tough patches.\n...No, don't open it yet. During the year ahead, this bag will open itself when the right time comes.",

  " Please stay indoors until the storm passes. I will deal with any urgent outdoor business.",

  " Can you hear the Anemo Archon's voice on the breeze? It calms me down whenever I get flustered.",
  " Good morning! Breakfast is served. I will be on hand the whole time. Should you find that anything is not to your taste, please, do not hesitate to let me know.",
  " Ready for your tea break? Please wait here while I get it ready. Oh yes, I also made Lighter-Than-Air Pancakes! You simply must try one, it's my specialty.(Actual Voice-Over: Ready for your tea break? Please wait here while I get it ready. Oh yes, I also made Tea Break Pancakes! You simply must try one, it's my specialty.)",
  " Everyone has free time in the evening, and that is when I am busiest. Where have Amber's washed hairbands been placed? How many new eyepatches did Kaeya buy? Keeping track of all these things is a maid's responsibility.",
  " Please get some rest, you must be tired from today's adventure. I should head back to the Knights of F- Sorry? you want me to watch over you until you fall asleep? I-I... I mean, of course, it's no problem. But, um... You're not just teasing me, are you?",
  " In my job I do the exact same things every day \u2014 a far cry from being a true knight, that's for sure. But ultimately this is all part of my training, and when it comes to training, actions speak louder than words.",
  " I'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly. People find that hard to understand, so instead, I try to just get on with my work in my own way. But then they call me stubborn. All I try to do is convince people with results instead of trying to talk them round... Is that really stubborn of me?",
  " I am devoted to what I do, but make no mistake \u2014 I devote myself freely. A maid, to me, is the most liberating job there is. I'm a chef, a gardener, a warrior, a guide... I can be anything you need me to be!",
  " Even when you're too busy to eat three square meals, never eat something if you don't know where it came from, and always maintain a balance between meat and vegetables. Oh, and no swimming right after a meal. Haha, I do hope you're not thinking, \"that's too much trouble I'll just leave it to Noelle,\" are you? ... Oh... but of course, if you are... Well then, just leave it to me.",
  " So I hear you're an Honorary Knight of Favonius? I envy you! I suppose that makes you my senior... Anyway, it's about time someone threw you a welcome party, surely? Leave it to me!",
  " To be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius...",
  " I actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There have been a few times when I could have had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older.",
  " A maid is required to keep everyone's secrets. That's why my favorite flower is the rose. Here in Mondstadt, the rose represents the saying \"As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed.\" It reminds me to\u2014 What? ...Roses represent love in your hometown? I\u2014I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning.",
  " I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright, don't you think?(Actual Voice-Over: I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright, I think. Oh no, please do not be alarmed! There is no risk of explosion whatsoever.)",
  " I've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in a solitary confinement...",
  " Master Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!",
  " At first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no \u2014 it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!",
  " He's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, \"errand runner\"? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!",
  " He's asked me to join the Adventurer's Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his \"dads\" like the other adventurers. the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer.",
  " I think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely, I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.",
  " So once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her.",
  " We take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara.",
  " How may I be of assistance? ...Oh, you just want to chat? Okay then! Well, if that's how I can help, then please feel free to chat as long as you'd like.",
  " Not a problem, I am here to serve in whatever capacity you require. You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing. I, on the other hand, feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you.",
  " Th-These treats are for me? Oh no, I couldn't, really. Well... Then I'll make some for you too! I'll go right now, right this instant! Half an hour... Ah, ok maybe an hour, tops. You can busy yourself with other things first, and I'll be sure to deliver them right to you, hot and fresh out of the oven!",
  " I spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters, but so long as it helps you in your adventure, or makes your life easier in some small way, I couldn't be happier. That's because each time I get a thank-you, it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning, no matter how insignificant it seems.",
  " Even though I mostly work for the Knights of Favonius, I'm always looking out for ways I can help more people. These days, though, I seem to be spending more and more of my time with you... It might be a bit selfish of me... What do you think?",
  " My hobby? I really like washing all sorts of things... clothes, floorboards, windows, you name it! Whenever I see something dirty I just want to give it a good old clean! It just gives me such a sense of achievement! ...Oh, you mean the things I do in my free time? Hmm... Same answer!",
  " How to get more for your Mora? Last time I went all the way to Liyue, I visited every single shop to compare prices, and then carried everything back myself... I won't be doing that again though. I was on the road for so long that Jean was convinced I'd been gobbled up by Stormterror along the way!",
  " My favorite is easily a Satisfying Salad. The best of Mondstadt's natural produce on one plate \u2014 highly nutritious, and a low calorie count. No, I never get sick of eating it \u2014 it's delicious! I've been eating it for ten years now.",
  " I'm not a fussy eater. But I really don't like banquets... The reason being, as the maid I am expected to sample every single dish on the table to ensure its quality. Just one bite of each, of course, but it all adds up... Oh, the guilt...",
  " Since you're always so busy adventuring, there must be so many little things you never get round to, surely? Well, you need not worry about them adding up, because today, I am all yours - your exclusive maid for the entire day! Just leave it all to me! ...Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you a very happy birthday!",
  " What is this... new power!? Thank you! Now I can be of assistance to even more people.",
  " I cannot rest on my laurels. After all, I'm not even formally a knight yet. Until that day, I must work even harder.",
  " Thank you for the opportunity to accompany you on your adventures, it's taught me a lot and I believe I have improved a lot. As a maid, I should be the one serving you, but it seems you have done more for me than I could ever imagine...",
  " Everyone in Mondstadt is saying that I'm much more reliable now. Some even say that I'm to be made a true knight soon, but I don't think... What!? You think so too!? Oooohh, thank you! Coming from you, that is the best compliment I could ever hope for!"

  " Do you wish to know the truth about the shooting stars at night? Haha, they are but fleeting moments of luminosity. Uh, you used to be one of them? Are you a tengu warrior?",
  " Despite serving as my guard during this journey, you need not shield me from danger. The Shogun's constitution is rather robust, and in the event she does break down, we can simply get a replacement. In an emergency, just send her into the fray.",
  " The Inazuman arts of polearm and sword combat, as well as the blade-forging process itself, primarily originated with me. Since then, they have branched out and blossomed into a variety of techniques according to each master's individual aptitude.What would you say to another sparring session? If you emerge unscathed again, I'll let you found your own martial arts tradition in Inazuma. Ah, the drive to advance and evolve in the martial arts is truly unstoppable.",
  " Really? So in all this time, no new Electro Visions have appeared in the outside world? Well, what I can say on this topic is subject to certain constraints, but... it is not by my will that Visions are granted or denied. The key is people's desire, and... well, there's another side to it too.",
  " Ah, that girl... She used to be the kind of person who could easily be swayed with some Fried Tofu. It's a relief to see how shrewd and resourceful she's now become. Still, I have to admit that I was a little upset to become the target of her scheming myself. I know it was for my own good, but I'm afraid she will mock me next time we meet... Perhaps I should take the initiative and strike her first? Hmm, she'll dodge it anyway.",
  " Kamisato... One of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma. Eh? That's exactly what the Shogun said? Well, A\u2014Ayaka's also well-versed in the art of the sword.",
  " I can't deny that I am somewhat culpable in the events that led to him being almost stripped of his Vision, but I rather think the Shogun should be the one to extend a formal apology to him... Okay, fine. I'll give it some more thought.",
  " He came about as a byproduct of creating the Shogun. Perhaps it's because I feel like I owe him something, but I do not wish to assert control over him.",

  " That's the name the Anemo Archon takes these days, is it? Truth be told, from the very first moment I met him, I could somehow sense that we were not going to get along. Also, he sure can drink a lot.",
  " The account given in the book \"Treasured Tales\" is largely an accurate one. At that time, she was preoccupied with various domestic matters within the island, so as her kagemusha, I assumed her identity and joined the troops dispatched to pacify Watatsumi. After this point, however, the story turns into mere wishful thinking. Back then, I was just a martial artist wrapped up in all the fighting, not a social reformer or moral leader.",
  " Perhaps my pursuit of Eternity is nothing more than a form of escapism. In the end, the path I took was like that of a turtle who hides in its shell. Still, turtles have always been a symbol of longevity. Perhaps in order to reach Eternity, one has to follow their example.",
  " I'm fearful because of what I witnessed five hundred years ago \u2014 her demise and that thing. But, if... If it were you, everyone would be safe. You would've saved the world. Just like I cherish the memories of everything in Inazuma, if you remember me, I'll live forever.",
  " Don't try and get me to cook. I can take care of anything else, but not that.",
  " Oh, don't listen to the Shogun. Desserts! Cavities are no big deal \u2014 you can just replace your teeth. Anyway, I just don't see how desserts can pose a serious obstacle to my pursuit of Eternity.",

I never had time to embark on my own adventure. So... there are many aspects of adventuring that I've yet to fully understand. Mm, you'll have to excuse my lack of experience in this area.",
  " It's said that the depths of a person's heart run deep indeed. Yet, as the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, it is my duty to strive to understand each person's thoughts. Let's start with you, Traveler. What are you thinking about now? Let me take a guess...",
  " In my book, Visions are symbols of aspiration, and aspiration is a precious thing indeed. This is exactly why the resistance was formed \u2014 to oppose the Vision Hunt Decree. Aspiration should never be abandoned or forcibly taken away.",
  " Among Yae Publishing House's various publications, my personal favorite is the Teyvat Art of War. See, it has articles on classic military campaigns, as well as detailed analysis and commentary from famous strategists. There are a few that I particularly enjoy... Here, let me read them to you.",
  " The world below water is not bright and sunny like that of dry land. Still, whenever I lend myself to the deep, my heart gradually fills with a permeating sense of peace. Fish move in faraway shoals, jellyfish dance around me, and my troubles start to simply wash away. Mmm... I could take you to see it sometime, what do you think?",
  " I simply love Watatsumi Coral Pearls... They're not just a source of income for Watatsumi Island, but a gift from the sea itself.",
  " Gorou is an exceptional general... sincere, determined, and courageous. He has a strong camaraderie with the troops and is able to come up with creative battle plans. He does, however, have one shortcoming... He often lets the excitement of battle get to his head. If you are ever deployed to the battlefield together, be sure to have a good rein on him when things get underway.",
  " Mmm... I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. She seldom employs cunning strategy, but her performance in open warfare is always admirable. The Shogun's Army places great trust in her abilities \u2014 they are united and ready to fight valiantly under her command, even to the death. Her forces have been a serious threat to the resistance on multiple occasions.",
  " I have also heard of Guuji Yae's great deeds. In all fairness, I hold her to be an outstanding shrine maiden, and she has performed her duties marvelously. I even heard that she holds responsibility where Yae Publishing House's light novels are concerned. An enigmatic individual to say the least...",
  " Now that the Vision Hunt Decree is over, Watatsumi Island has once again returned to normal life. It has never been my intent to scrutinize the rights and wrongs of the Shogun's actions, even to this day. What I do care about is the future of our island. It is my hope that the Shogun will fulfill her promise and that we can live with the Shogunate in peace. However, if there comes a day when she once again casts aside the aspirations of the people, I can assure you that we won't sit by and watch.",
  " Ah... back when Beidou and I were carrying out ambushes against the Shogun's Army together, I raised my concerns that the enemy might detect our approach. But Beidou assured me of her fleet's unwavering discipline, and that raids could be carried out without detection. In the end, she was right, and that's exactly what happened. Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship...",
  " Kazuha once came and bunked with the resistance for a time. If I'm not mistaken, he got along very well with Gorou \u2014 they would often fight side-by-side in battle. Kazuha has a carefree personality and doesn't like constraints, but he would follow every command to the letter when he was among our ranks. In my opinion, not only is he an outstanding swordsman, but a very refined character.",
  " Initially, I was astonished to see anyone coming to Watatsumi Island wearing a Tenryou Commission uniform. A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed \"detective\" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself.",
  " No matter how pressing the situation may become, I must remain composed. If I let the stress get to me, then what can I expect from others around me?",
  " Legend has it that our ancestors lived in a palace in the depths of the ocean, and that the god, Orobashi, brought us to the surface. I've often wondered, wouldn't a palace like that be too dark? Every time I think about it, I start to really appreciate the light...",
  " After you left, the soldiers of Swordfish II nominated a temporary captain, but everyone was hoping that you'd return. I could only tell them that you'd been tasked with an important solo mission. If you get the chance, you should go visit them, I'm sure they'd love to see you.",
  " A long time ago, I had no intention of becoming the Divine Priestess. My only goal was to study military strategy and become an adviser. That way, I could remain behind the scenes and lessen my overall burden. *sigh* Fate had other ideas in store... You can't defy that which flows in your veins.",
  " After becoming the Divine Priestess, I gradually grew accustomed to this life. At the very least, I have the power to change something when it doesn't sit well with me. More importantly, this title allowed me to meet you, did it not?",
  " Huh? What do I enjoy? Simple. I like to find a quiet place by myself and read books on strategy... Ahh, the whole day without interruption. I'd be even happier if we looked over some of it together... One thing though... You'd have to sleep on the floor.",
  " To be quite honest, I'm not particularly skilled at communicating with others. Putting on my \"Divine Priestess airs\" certainly makes things easier, but once I run out of energy, I start to get a bit negative. I prevent others from seeing that side of me at all costs. The people of Watatsumi Island need a perfect leader, not some girl who likes to wile away her time at home.",
  " I just love eating Bird Egg Sushi. The ingredients are easy to find, and it's simple to prepare... Ah... perfect for military life. Sitting down to eat Bird Egg Sushi in the midst of war might seem a bit extravagant, but in most cases, simple food like this brings great satisfaction to the soldiers.",
  " Mm... If I had to say, I'm not fond of any sort of seafood. But please, keep this strictly confidential. The fishing industry is essential to Watatsumi Island, and if word were to get out that seafood wasn't my thing, I'm afraid morale would be gravely affected.",
  " Happy birthday! So, what are your plans for the day? Oh, why don't we celebrate on Watatsumi Island? First, I'll take you out at daybreak to see the sunrise, then we can go diving during the heat of the day. In the evening, we can go for a stroll around Sangonomiya Shrine. If it rains, we'll find somewhere cozy to hide out with a few strategy books, and try to bake a cake together! In any case, no need to plan anything, the grand strategist has everything thought out for you!",
  " Brute force is not my modus operandi. But becoming stronger isn't a bad thing.",
  " I'm just bubbling with energy... We'll make a formidable force in our next fight.",
  " The moon shines bright over the depths of the seas as the tides come and go. It seems that as I go from strength to strength, so does my state of mind flow.",
  " I often used to succumb to self-doubt. I would think to myself, \"Can a person like me really hold the title of Divine Priestess?\" Now, the thought hardly crosses my mind. When I'm with you, I seem to be able to cut straight through most problems."

 "Sayu": [
  " Sayu, Shuumatsuban, at your disposal! Whew, but if you don't need me right now, I'm gonna grab some sleep. Nope, no need to tuck me in \u2014 I need the extra room to grow into.",
  " *yawns* *snoring*",
  " Seems like I should have just stayed in bed today.",
  " Surely I should be due a growth spurt by now?",
  " Eek, let's find shelter, quick! Watering works on plants, but not people...",
  " Phew, this weather is wild! Best thing to do is dive under the covers where it's dark and snug and warm and nyam nyam nyam~ *sleeps*",
  " It's really easy to hide in weather like this. There's this ninjutsu technique called Cloak of Snow where you can pretty much make yourself invisible \u2014 all other people see when they look at you is the snowflakes dancing in the air. Wait, it's confidential though! Don't tell any of this to the shrine maiden...",
  " Loooove it when the weather's like this, just makes you wanna... *yawn* doze off for a while.",
  " A windy day is a good day for a getaway.",
  " I always know it's time to get some shut-eye when the wind's so strong that I can't open my eyes anyway.",
  " ...Morning? Already? Okay, I'm just gonna snooze for, like, 10 more minutes... Please, just 10 minutes... No? Okay, 5 minutes then? *snores*",
  " Is it noon yet? Finally, I'm so ready for my nap.",
  " Recon confirms, no sign of the shrine maiden within a 3-mile radius. Moving to the next phase: sleepy time!",
  " At long last... bed time... G'night...",
  " Yeah, I'm in the Shuumatsuban, but they only ever get me to do stuff like... *yawn* information gathering and stealing. So, y'know... it's not really a big deal if the work doesn't get done.",
  " So I don't do any important work at the Shuumatsuban, and anything that gets put off for long enough ends up getting done by someone who's more suited to it anyway. Sleep, on the other hand \u2014 that is of the utmost importance. Because I need to get enough sleep to make sure I get my growth spurt.",
  " Hey, will you do me a favor and let me know if you see the shrine maiden coming? I'm just gonna, um... rest my eyes for a moment.",
  " I'm not a pet, y'know! Hmm, but since it's you... Okay, you can pat my head and I promise not to bite your hand. Just a little, though! If you pat someone's head too much, it stunts their growth.",
  " My sword is crazy heavy, even with my ninjutsu training there's no way I could lift it without the help of my Vision. So yeah, having a Vision is a huge help for me.",
  " Sensei says I'll be the last ninja ever in our line. I guess it can't be helped, because this style of ninjutsu wouldn't be much help in a fight anyway \u2014 all I've been taught is how to escape and how to cover your tracks.",
  " Do you know the mujina? It looks similar to a tanuki, but it's way cuter. I'll take you to see one next time!",
  " As the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan, she always looks very graceful and elegant. But she got one of the shrine maidens to keep tabs on me and make sure I don't slack off... Why would she do that?",
  " Sometimes, when I'm taking a rest up in a tree, I overhear the shrine maidens talking about him. Sounds like he's pretty important and super busy most of the time. I don't get it, though \u2014 it's only work, or whatever, so why doesn't he just... not do it?",
  " He's got a Vision, and yet for some reason he pesters me about learning ninjutsu every time I run into him. I don't know what his deal is. It's not like I'd have the time to teach him anyway, I barely get enough sleep as it is.",
  " Every time she sees me she says, \"Hey, little tanuki! Let's go hang out at the festival.\" Firstly, I'm not a tanuki. Secondly, I don't wanna go to a festival. Thirdly, she says she wants to hang out \u2014 but really, she just wants me to do a ninjutsu performance during the fireworks show. That's not even related to my work for the Shuumatsuban!",
  " Her Excellency? Definitely not someone I'd ever get to meet. If you've got questions, maybe Miss Ayaka's the person to ask.",
  " She's always patting me on the head... I've never bitten her, though, or even said anything, because I'm frightened of how she'd react if I stood up to her. But what am I gonna do? Because if she keeps on patting my head, I'm gonna get stuck at this height forever!",
  " Why does he have to make such a racket? And how did he get so tall!?",
  " Doesn't ring a bell, umm... What? Arataki Itto's little sidekick? Ugh, well she's definitely gotta be a sleep disturbance then. Birds of a feather flock together...",
  " Zzzz...",
  " Huh? You wanna know the name of my style of ninjutsu? Uhh... Y'know what, I can't think straight right now, I'm still half asleep here. Lemme snooze a while longer, maybe my mind'll be clearer when I wake up.",
  " Alright, fine... I'll tell you. But you'd better not laugh, or I'm never talking to you again. Uh so, my style of ninjutsu is called... um... Yoohoo Art.The reason is supposedly that our style focuses on making fun of the enemy, but still... I mean... *sigh*",
  " Do you know how to climb trees? I'm an expert, I can teach you. There's this tree down at the shrine \u2014 it's the perfect place, you could just literally sleep there all day if you wanted and no one would ever find you... Uh, I just mean, it's a great place for a power nap. Next time you wanna take a nap, let me know, I'll take you there.",
  " It was actually sensei who gave me this outfit. They said it was modeled after the mujina, and it could help with escapes, or something... and then sensei said that I was all grown up and ready to go it alone, but that I should still be careful to protect myself... then they left me. Am I really ready to go it alone, at my height?Um... Hmm? Y\u2014You'll keep my company? Really? Promise you won't leave me?",
  " When I put my hood on, I can snooze away to my heart's content without having to worry about the shrine maiden finding me. *sigh* I think it must be one of the best feelings in the whole world.",
  " For some reason, when people meet me for the first time, they always call me tanuki, or teddy-bear, or kitty-cat... But Sayu is just Sayu \u2014 and definitely not a tanuki.",
  " When is my growth spurt gonna come? Everyone my age practically twice my height, and I'm still... Ugh, enough, I need sleep, sleep is the answer. Good night!",
  " Recently someone told me that if you get annoyed too easily, that'll stunt your growth, too! ...Gah! I dunno what I can do about that...",
  " High-carb foods that give you instant energy, like rice balls. If you eat one the moment you wake up, it stops you feeling so groggy and bleary-eyed. Then, you can just relax and get straight back to sleep.",
  " Can't be picky about food when you've still got growing to do! ...That said, I haven't gained any height recently \u2014 maybe I'm not eating enough vegetables? But salad isn't filling enough and sometimes it can be really bitter... *sigh*",
  " Wanna learn some ninja skills? I can teach you! Well, only the skills I know, of course. Hmm? Why aren't I asleep? ...Uhh, because I'm not sleepy... and also because today is a special day! I had to stay awake today so I'd have the chance to say it to you in person: Happy Birthday.",
  " Is it just me, or did I get a little taller!?",
  " Awesome, now I can slip away faster than ever. Hee-hee, they can't catch me now.",
  " Hey, thanks for going and gathering all those materials for me. I would've gone myself, but... I probably would've got about halfway before falling asleep.",
  " I think I'm finally ready to go it alone now, just like sensei said I should. And... maybe it's not such a big deal now if I can't grow any taller. Because what really matters... is that I have you to keep me company."

 "Shenhe": [
  " My name is Shenhe. I was born fated to bear the curse of calamity, so I am prone to bring harm to the people around me. The adepti urged me to bind my soul with red ropes to keep my homicidal nature at bay. If you are able to walk alongside me without fear... Hah, very well. Now, give me your hand.",
  " The assumption that every person has somewhere to call home is naive. I got used to living in the mountains alongside the birds and beasts a long time ago.",
  " Mind be purged, world be saved.",
  " My polearm doesn't distinguish friend from foe, and there is clearly a limit to the red ropes' power. That's why I loathe crowded areas.",
  " In the mortal world, at times likes these, is it not customary to... use an umbrella?",
  " The sky is clearing up, and so is my mood. I just hope no one shows up to bother me... if they do, I'll just make them disappear.",
  " In this weather, I can freeze monsters in place and simply let the lightning bolts take care of the rest. A good way to not get my clothes dirty.",
  " Yes... This reminds me of Master. She loves to ride the swift winds of Qingyun Peak.",
  " Good morning. The dew is very sweet today, would you like some?",
  " If you feel fatigued after lunch, you should try meditating. It's very effective.",
  " Do you prefer the artificial light of the cities and towns, or the moonlight in the mountains?",
  " Feel free to rest. I'm a light sleeper, if I hear anything in the vicinity, I'll investigate it for you.",
  " For all the training I've had \u2014 honing my body and mind, learning the adepti arts \u2014 I've mostly been guided by my own instincts. It just comes down to self-preservation. I'm not trying to save the world, so if I wipe out some evil presence and it happens to benefit you, don't thank me. It's just a force of habit.",
  " If I treat people kindly, they call me an adeptus, and if I put them in their place, they call me a witch. Heh... The one thing you'll never hear them call me is \"human.\" They all seem to agree that I'm fundamentally... different from them.",
  " I rarely leave the mountains, so I was never taught proper manners. When a conflict arises, I just take care of it the way that comes naturally to me. But if you don't approve of my methods, please do let me know. Even if I don't fully understand your reasoning, I will always defer to you.",
  " My master gave me these red ropes in order to restrain my impulses. But during our journey together, I feel I have finally grasped the key to all of this. Somehow, controlling my strength \u2014 knowing when to restrain myself, and when to unleash \u2014 it comes more naturally to me now. I think that what saves me from myself is not my red ropes... but you. If you understand what that means to me, please stay by my side.",
  " So this shiny gemstone is called a \"Vision\"? Heh... the gifts that fate brings, fate can just easily take away. If one day my connection to this Vision comes to an end, that'll be it, and the light inside of it will go out.",
  " Driving evil spirits away comes easily to me. Getting rid of my inner demons, however... Unless you can find a way to let go, all the adepti arts and exorcism techniques in the world can't save you.",
  " Why do I always hear people say, \"The first snow of the season is a sight for sore eyes\"? We have snow every single day in the mountains. So which instance counts as the \"first snow\"? I don't understand what they mean. Please explain this to me.",
  " I have no use for the wealth that ordinary people desire. But in the hands of Lady Ningguang, wealth becomes a means of solving complex issues of the kind that no weapons could ever hope to resolve. She understands the unwritten rules of human society, she knows what's in people's hearts... Master once told me that even the adepti aren't able to achieve this. I hold her and her work in high regard.",
  " I find I don't need to worry about etiquette with her, and unlike with some people, I don't need to rely on non-verbal cues to discern the true meaning of what she's saying. That makes me a lot more comfortable. The only problem is... Well, there are too many people around her all the time, and I heard there's also many crew members on her ship... I need you to go with me. It's the only way I can cope with so many people.",
  " Yun Jin performs... It's called \"Liyue opera,\" isn't it? I like this particular type of social interaction. You can get to know about the other person's background without having to actually interact with them one on one. If she ever includes your story in one of her performances, I'm sure the result will end up being quite incredible. I'm looking forward to it.",
  " I've heard many stories about her from my master. She's really quite different from how I originally imagined her... But don't worry, I'll be keeping this to myself. Speaking of Ganyu, her work in Liyue Harbor is unbelievably busy... It seems that there is a price to pay for those who want to integrate into the mortal world.",
  " It's hard for me to believe that... I still have living relatives in this world. If he has any difficulties with his training, I am more than willing to help enlighten him. However, he will need to meet me alone in the mountains. Their family is too... sociable. I wouldn't know how to turn down their invitations without being impolite.",
  " I've seen him lean over to you and whisper things in your ear. If he dares threaten you, I will make sure he... Hmm? You mean it's just an in-joke between friends? Genuinely...?",
  " That gentleman claims to be a mortal, yet is very familiar with my master, who is an adeptus. Master once said: \"If you see him drinking on a stone stool in front of my abode, do not disturb him. Let him sit quietly for a while.\" And that's precisely what I did.",
  " The quality of his medicinal herbs is as good as it gets, he is also easy-going and considerate of others. By comparison, the little snake on his neck has no filter at all... Haha, don't worry, I didn't lift a finger against it, I won't go as far as getting into a quarrel with a snake.",
  " I often see her wandering in the woods singing strange songs. Actually, I must have heard all of her songs several times each by now. I'm used to her singing, but I still find it strange. That being said, I don't hate it either.",
  " My first impression of him was that he's not one to smile. After meeting him again more recently, however, he's still as reserved as ever, but... he seems a lot more relaxed now. Maybe he... met someone special.",
  " Please don't pay any heed to the way most people refer to me. I am not an adeptus, and don't possess any divine abilities. I was born in a branch family of a clan of exorcists, and grew up in the mountains far away from Liyue Harbor. I am but an adeptus's disciple, nothing more, nothing less.",
  " When faced with delinquents who are just out to cause trouble, most people will try to reason with them. This course of action perplexes me. Removing the root of the problem and disposing of these ill-intentioned fools seems like the obvious course of action. Why do common folks prefer the labor-intensive route?",
  " I am the apprentice of multiple adepti and have trained alongside them. After a certain point, however, they stopped teaching me new techniques and started focusing on how to control my intense homicidal urges. Oh, don't be nervous... Yes, craters have been left in the ground, and giant trees have been uprooted. But these things only ever happen in the mountains, far away from civilization, and certainly have never affected innocent lives. Besides, I can control myself now.",
  " My father's intent was to trade my flesh and blood for my mother's life. After he abandoned me in that cave, I still held out hope that he'd come back to rescue me. One day went by. Then two days, three days... I used every ounce of energy in my body to fight off that monster. But as I collapsed on the ground, I finally realized that the day I was waiting for would never come. To this day, I don't which one it is... Was I was abandoned because I'm cursed, or is it the way I've been treated in life that has cursed me?",
  " Once, I secretly left the mountain and returned to my childhood village without telling my master. But it was deserted, and my father had long since passed away. I suddenly realized that the bond between my relatives and I had been completely severed. And nothing that I'd ever cared about in the past could ever have a future. Ever since then, I have abandoned everything related to the mortal world... That is, until I met you.",
  " The most important aspect of meditation is stillness. Let go of all agitation, and let the air around you flow into your body. This technique allows me to quickly focus in on myself. I heard from my master that after meditating beyond a certain point, there is no need to adopt the meditation posture anymore. Adepti can meditate even when standing up... I still have much more to improve on.",
  " The fear of losing the people most important to me, and the desire to save them... This kind of feeling makes my heart ache, I've never experienced anything like it before. It's a burden, yes, but it's also... something to hold onto.",
  " I've sampled numerous dishes during my time away from the mountains, but the truth is that I don't really remember how they taste. The only dish I can never forget the flavor of is that bowl of noodles I ate at home, so long ago... I shouldn't have to remember that. Why do I have to remember that?",
  " Chew medicinal herbs for long enough, and you can only taste the bitterness... In all the years I trained under the adepti, I had to abstain from all kinds of things, and to a point, I got used to it. But them... \"The common delights of the mortal realm pose no hindrance to the adepti, thus, we may indulge in all manner of dishes as we please\"... These are the exact words my master said.",
  " I've been told that birthdays are important occasions for most people. They give presents to celebrate the anniversary of the other person's birth. Material possessions aren't really my thing, but... The view of the starry night sky in the mountains is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I've frozen this lake and turned it into a mirror, so you can appreciate the reflection of the fleeting clouds and distant stars right up close. This is my way of celebrating your birthday... Hope you like it.",
  " The power I harness... It grows stronger.",
  " If my master were to learn about this, she'd probably have me add some more red ropes...",
  " I haven't been training as single-mindedly lately, and yet it's as if I'm growing stronger and stronger without making a conscious effort... I'm left to assume the only way for me to achieve this is by your side.",
  " I once believed that freeing my mind from all agitation was the only way to overcome. But after everything I've experienced recently, I finally understand... Only when the right things weigh on your mind can the desire to protect awaken inside of you. And that turns your power into something... meaningful."

If you're willing, I'd love to hear any stories you have about your adventures. I'd... really like that.",
  " What was that? Oh... It's gone. Can I go take a look?",
  " I just need a moment to quickly take down some notes.",
  " Ahhh! I haven't been out in a while.",
  " The windmills are spinning faster than usual today. Hey, do you think if an animal put a propeller on its back and started running... Do you think the propeller would make it run faster? Or even, fly?",
  " Snow this big only falls a few times a year. If I miss it, I'll have to wait until next year to run my experiments, so please give me some space. Ah-Ahchooo! ...Yes, I know, I should wear more layers...",
  " Th-The sun is already out? Oh, ah, okay! Just one last experiment, and then we can get some rest. Last one, I promise...",
  " Humidity levels are increasing... Think we could run some tests?",
  " Good morning. Did you sleep well? According to research, not getting a good night's sleep can have detrimental effects on your cognition and stamina. What? I'm always up working through the night? Yeah, I know... Can't be helped I guess...",
  " Waaaaa! No, stay back, don't come over here! No, no, it's nothing personal \u2014 it's just that this experiment is highly volatile and might cause an explosion.",
  " Good evening. Please wait a moment. Experiment 905 has actually produced two light excretions, which, for clarity's sake, should be labeled No. 1033 and 1035 respectively...Right, now, what did you need me for?",
  " No need to wait up for me. Please, get some sleep.Something bothering you? Oh, don't worry about me \u2014 I'm right at the end of my experiment. I promise you I won't stay up late again...",
  " Bio-alchemy, when compared with creation, places more emphasis on transformation. Finding those little secrets that living creatures have and scaling them up, combining them \u2014 the results are always such a surprise. Life really is fascinating. Just how much do we really know?",
  " I... um... really don't know how to act around new people. Everyone's personality is different, as are the things they care about. If I slip up and say the wrong thing I'll offend someone, or sound impolite... Talking is hard, so much harder than alchemy.",
  " Oh, you ahh... noticed. My ears are a hereditary feature... quite different from everyone else's. So, I try to hide them with my hair as much as possible.",
  " I'm curious to know about your background. I was wondering... could I perhaps... observe you for a while. I'll be silent, and I won't interfere with what you're doing. Would... that be okay?",
  " To be honest, I was a little afraid when we first met, because you don't talk much... I thought I must have offended you somehow. But then as time went on, I discovered you're really easy to get along with. Hehe, just an unexpected outcome of my observations.",
  " I heard it was you that dealt with the Stormterror issue. No doubt it was a dangerous fight - it's a good thing you came out unscathed. I was ahh... also wondering - did Stormterror  happen to drop anything during the fight? you know, a scale, some skin - even just a little would be fine. There are some tests I'd like to run.",
  " My Vision is my most important research tool. Hmm? Why without it I'd be unable to proceed with most of my research. Combat? Oh, I suppose I use it for that too when I'm out in the field looking for materials.",
  " This room is where I keep all the bones I've collected. On the table on the left we have lizards, frogs, and grass carp. To the front we have the bones of a wild boar, and then over there in the right corner is a hilichurl... Oh, don't be nervous, nothing to be afraid of. They're really quite cute once you get used to them.",
  " If you look closely, you'll notice that the Mist Flowers I've planted here are all different. This one is the most powerful, this one blooms the longest... Hmm? This one? Oh, this one is project 3, version 17, enlargement trial. It's defining trait is that... it's a bit larger.",
  " She's a really willing helper, I can't deny that. It's just... she makes me a bit anxious is all. One time, she saw three boxes of materials stacked just outside my laboratory door, and proceeded to move them inside for me. A nice gesture, but the thing is... I'd only just finished putting them outside...",
  " Jean has put her in solitary confinement so many times, but every time she's let out it's not long before she's back in trouble. *Sigh* Something tells me she hasn't done much introspection. I told her I'd make her a bouncing, dancing Jumpy Dumpty that is also safe - but to date there are still a lot of problems with the design.",
  " I don't dare talk to Master Jean that much, because she's so strict. I know she's a good person and all \u2014 I know that, I do \u2014 but... I still find her scary. I don't tend to bother her, and even when I have to... I ask Albedo to go on my behalf.",
  " She really seems to know a great deal. She's obviously never seen my research, and yet on so many occasions she's given me advice on what is core to my studies. Just how does she know? Is it observation, or is it ratiocination?",
  " Oh... I know he likes to joke, and isn't trying to make fun of me, but I often struggle to work out which parts are the truth and which parts are jokes. So whenever he talks to me, the outcome is either one of two things: morbid embarrassment or unbearable awkwardness.",
  " As his Assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, its where alchemy meets art.",
  " Talent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research \u2014 I'd spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying of bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams \u2014 nothing more.",
  " I'm curious to why her doll is called \"Baron Bunny,\" it clearly has nothing to do with a rabbit at all. Oh, the headband makes it look like it has rabbit ears you say? Hmm... that's heavily reliant on the rabbit stereotype, is it not? Many rabbits' ears are floppy.",
  " I take it you're referring to the book series, Flowers for Princess Fischl? Indeed, the world the author came up with is very creative. If only I could go and see it with my own eyes. Oh? you're referring to Fischl herself? I am... doubtful that she could really take me there.",
  " The role of a scout is a hazardous one, and Ms. Eula throws herself into danger all too easily. So, I made a reconnaissance device for her, so that she wouldn't have to infiltrate enemy camps herself. But Ms. Eula has such an imposing manner, she really puts me on edge, and... I was so nervous that I accidentally left out a few important details while explaining how to use it... As a result, there was an accident...\nAh, what should I do... I hope she won't hold a grudge against me...",
  " You want to know more about me? You... must have an interest in bio-alchemy then? Whatever you ask, I will be sure to give you the most precise answer possible. Oh, it really is me specifically that you are interested in? I'm ahh... oh. I'm at a loss for words.",
  " The essence of research is the process of finding the answer. Sometimes, working through that process can be tedious, but every time I see the cumulative result of my efforts... I know that I'm doing what I love.",
  " When I was little, I had two good friends - we kept nothing from each other. I thought I knew everything about them, but then... stuff happened, and we grew distant. As for where they are now, what they're doing, whether or not they remember me... I have no idea. Even though we were best friends, things still turned out this way.",
  " Let me tell you a little secret, something I've never told anyone. The purpose behind my research is to create my own wonderland. Yes... just like the ones in fairy tales. The kind where all your dreams come true and you live happily ever after. Hehe, it's childish, isn't it? But I still believe in fairy tales.",
  " If you're busy, please don't let me stand in the way of progress. You're not busy? Really? Its fine, I get that you have stuff to do, I'm already quite used to to working alone. You're truly not busy? In-in that case, I don't suppose you could help me with a few things? Or you know, we could just sit and chat about... stuff.",
  " I like things that look orderly. See? All my research notes are compiled in the notebooks of the exact same thickness. All my potions are lined up according to effect and hue\u2014 Wh\u2014What!? What is this purple potion doing here!? Sorry, I-I need to reassess the order of these potions!",
  " I wonder... What is it that you do in your free time? Every time I get a break, I can never find anything to do, I just find myself staring off into space. Time goes by so quickly when I'm experimenting, so how is it that when I'm not doing anything the days all feel like years...",
  " I extract the nectar from Sweet Flowers to make candy. When I get stuck in a rut I just pop one in my mouth and my focus returns. Retaining optimal blood sugar levels during research is essential.",
  " Once I came to understand more about bio-alchemy, I stopped eating mushrooms. You're no doubt aware? Mushrooms grow on that which has died, which in turn makes me think of other such things, and my appetite just disappears... Blergh...",
  " Happy Birthday! I've been running experiments for months, and finally, I can give you this potion. It will allow you to relive your most beautiful memories of the past year. I call it \"Bio-potion No. 3916.\" Huh? No, no, not 3196, it's 3916!",
  " Finally, a break through in my bio-alchemy research.",
  " This trip has allowed me to gather a good number of materials. Thank you, I'll be sure to put them to good use.",
  " Recently during my experiments, I've found myself suddenly wondering when I'll next get to go on an adventure with you. So strange... Why do you think that is? I need to do some scientific investigation to find out.",
  " I have such an abundant array of research materials now! To spend any more time on me would... would really be a waste of your time! At least... let me use my bio-alchemy to make you up some kind of gift!"

  " You know, there are better ways to seek out our enemies than... well, standing here.",
  " This place is pretty dead... By which I mean, there's nothing to kill.",
  " I wonder what the rest of the Harbingers are up to? Plotting and scheming on an ever-grander scale, no doubt.",
  " Where I'm from, if we didn't keep moving, we'd freeze to death. Literally.",
  " Ah, perfect weather for fishing! The sound of the rain scares them away, but once it stops, they're yours for the taking.",
  " Haha, ahh... could it be snowing in Snezhnaya too?",
  " The world looks glorious in the snow. Pure white, like the light of the moon. A perfect backdrop for bloodshed.",
  " The wind is picking up. There is conflict in the air.",
  " Just look at that wind blow!",
  " The wind permeates all, cleansing both mind and body. Excellent.",
  " Morning, comrade! You're raring to go today, I see.",
  " You look well. What's your secret? Care to exchange notes?",
  " Whew, dinner was quite the feast. A spot of exercise is in order.",
  " Today was great. See you tomorrow, comrade!",
  " A warrior must always be ready to face any challenge with his blade. The outcome of the battle is irrelevant \u2014 what matters is that you learn from the experience.",
  " Ah, I'm sure the Harbingers must know of my dealings with you by now. Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces... Hahaha...",
  " I am the least adept with a bow. And that is precisely why I must master it.",
  " You wield such powers without owning a Vision... I really am excited to see what you have in store for us... Let's see how far you can go. Just don't go dying on me before you lay it all on the line in our own final battle! I won't allow it!",
  " Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could head-to-head with the Eleven and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.(Actual Voice-Over: Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that.

  " I once ventured deep into the abyss and came face to face with an enormous beast. I don't know its name, all I know is the sight of it chilled me to the bone. But mark my words, one day I will march back in there and behead that beast, and you, comrade, will be my witness!",
  " It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me...",
  " There's far more to that man than meets the eye. As for the extent of his power... lots to look forward to, I think.",
  " Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to \"mortal\" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha...",
  " Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you.",
  " Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world.",
  " Remember, comrade, one day I will conquer the world!",
  " Face me in person, man to man, and I'll always have a chance of beating you. Same goes if you're a deity or a monster from the abyss. But the Harbingers? They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along.",

  " Comrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, \"I'm on fire!\" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.",
  " Ah, how time flies. One day, you will see how I conquer the world and crush the thrones of gods beneath my heel. In the meantime... no dying, comrade! Keep yourself alive, haha.",
  " Ice fishing and combat follow the same principle. Patience and decisiveness are key. Though having said that... I suppose the same is true of everything in life.",

  " There's plenty of delicious food to sink your teeth into in this world... and plenty of fights to sink your teeth into as well. Life is beautiful.",

  " Ho, I feel like I've gotten stronger! Now, who shall I use as my guinea pig...",
  " \"A warrior's strength is like a dome. The bigger the dome, the more opponents he can challenge inside it.\" Hmm, who was it that said this again?",
  " Bravo, comrade! Thanks to your help, I am one step closer to my goal of conquering the world. I doubt even the Tsaritsa herself ever expected I would make it this far.",

  " I feel like there's something I forgot to do... hmm, I tidied the courtyard, put the tea on... Eh, it's probably just my mind playing tricks on me.",
  " I really did spend a lot recently, only 10 Mora left... Still, 10 Mora's better than no Mora!",
  " Where'd this rain come from? Are you gonna be okay? Here, I'll lend you my coat...",

  " On the lunch menu today, we have Sakura Tempura and Tricolor Dango! Here, there's some for you, some for Paimon, and I also put some aside for milady and the man of the clan himself. Ah, wait, I forgot someone... There's none for me...",
  " Come quick, we gotta get down to the market \u2014 they slash the prices on fish around this time of day. Oh, and if you find something that you just can't do without, I'll help you haggle the price down.",
  " Okay, good night. You had a busy day today, you should get some rest, too. Don't stay up late.",
  " It was never Ayaka or Ayato's intention to make me the housekeeper, I volunteered. I like this kind of work. Putting everything in order gives me a great sense of achievement, and based on everyone's reactions... Yeah, I think I do a pretty good job.",
  " For me, housework is about keeping a space clean and tidy, so that everyone who lives there has a smile on their face. And now... it looks like I'm responsible for another smile. I'll do my best to deliver!",
  " Hey, how come you're eating here all alone? ...Uh, is it okay if I join you? Or did you just want some space?",
  " If you hadn't put yourself out there during the Vision Hunt Ceremony and taken on the Raiden Shogun all by yourself, I would've lost my Vision, and with it all my aspirations. I've been thinking about this a lot, and it seems there's only one way I could ever properly repay you...I, Thoma, give to you my weapon and my loyalty, and I promise to fight for you, no matter what.",
  " Those that receive Visions should look after them. I certainly don't plan on losing mine.",
  " I've gotten to know all kinds of people over the years, and I'd say that Inazumans are more particular about etiquette than Mondstadters. If you make sure you're always polite to people, it's much easier to get things done.",
  " I've always wanted to see a tanuki shapeshifting. They say it can change into all kinds of things, and that it likes to play pranks on passersby. It's a creature with a sense of humor, that's for sure.",
  " Are you an animal person, too? If you are, let me take you to the outskirts some time, it's great. I just need to give a whistle, and all these puppies and kittens will come out of nowhere and start strutting around your ankles, clamoring for your affection. Haha, just imagining it is already brightening my day.",
  " Lady Miko? Wh\u2014What about her? *sigh* Every time Miss Kamisato sends me out to deliver messages, my least-favorite destination is the Grand Narukami Shrine... Oh! N\u2014Not because Lady Miko scares the bejeebers out of me, it's, uh... respect. Yes! She strikes respect deep into my heart, ahahahaha...",
  " In my homeland of Mondstadt, almost everyone has great reverence for the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. But people in Inazuma feel a little differently toward the Shogun. How can I put this... They feel love, respect, gratitude... but also fear.",
  " Honestly, I don't harbor any resentment toward the Shogun. Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that.The only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma? And why is sacrificing her people's aspirations so necessary to achieve it? I can neither understand nor agree with her approach.",
  " The captain of The Crux \u2014 a formidable woman indeed. She once promised to take me out onto the open ocean to get a look at the thunderstorm that seals off Inazuma from the outside world. It's a shame that to this day, I've never had the chance to take her up on the offer...",
  " As head of the Kamisato Clan, he's in a tough position. With all the political upheaval, he has to contend with public disquiet on one hand and a bunch of self-serving, degenerate public officials on the other. It's best not to dwell on it. All I can do is make sure to look out for him when he's at home.",
  " Milady is in all respects a well-rounded person: erudite, compassionate, well-mannered, and elegant... The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her \u2014 sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little.",
  " Of Naganohara Fireworks fame? She's so easy to get along with. Super straightforward, just says whatever she thinks. Oh, and Naganohara fireworks are just incredible, you should take every chance you get to see them in action. Ah, on that note \u2014 here, have a coupon!",
  " Ah Sayu, stubborn Sayu. I've asked her countless times to teach me ninjutsu, but she always refuses. She even goes out of her way to avoid me now... I'm just a student looking for a teacher, am I really that out of line?",
  " The Tenryou Commission General... Mm... Make sure to be extra careful if you have any dealings with her. She has a lot of power in her hands, and she's not very open to persuasion. Smiling and batting your eyelids certainly won't get you anywhere with her.",
  " Hmm... Word on the street is that he's quite a character \u2014 apparently, he even has youkai heritage. Have you met him? If you two are close, maybe you could introduce me sometime. It's good to make friends from all walks of life... youkai included!",
  " Ho, that guy is a detective for the Tenryou Commission. He seems to have his own way of doing things \u2014 not the easiest person to get along with. Also... Any situation that involves a detective is probably not one that's going to end well. I think I'll keep on giving him a wide berth.",
  " Oh, so Jean from the Gunnhildr Clan is the Master of the Knights of Favonius now? She definitely deserves it, she's known all over for her impeccable conduct... Oh, just the \"Acting\" Grand Master? Haha, well, someone of her standing won't care about titles.",
  " You've had a run-in with Eula Lawrence before, huh? All I know is that their whole family are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet. You're better off steering clear of them if you can help it. Ah, now I'm in a Mondstadt mood again... The memories.",
  " Anything I can lend a hand with? If something needs doing around the house or you're having some interpersonal strife, just say the word. Hmm? A conversation... I see, I see. That's a little different from what I'm used to, but I'm all for it.",
  " I'm not from Inazuma originally \u2014 I think I've told you that before, right? I took a boat all the way here from Mondstadt, found I liked the place, and was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful Kamisato siblings, so I just ended up staying.",
  " I get homesick once in a while, too, so I completely relate to all the international merchants on Ritou. I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders.",
  " For some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me.",
  " I'm not sure if I should get into this, but... Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home \u2014 Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?",
  " I've been really getting into stories about the unnatural recently. Especially ones about shapeshifting youkai \u2014 they're so fascinating. Before that, I was really into ninjutsu for a while, and before that... Hmm? You think I'm not dedicated enough? N\u2014No! It's not like that, you got me all wrong!",
  " I'm in a real pickle here. The chief is hosting a banquet for his friends tonight, and he says he wants me to splurge a little by cooking some Butter Crab. The only problem is that for the last two days, I haven't been able to buy crab anywhere! So, what, am I gonna have to dive into the ocean and grab them myself?",
  " Without a doubt, my favorite food is Rice Cake Soup. I like cooking up a big, delicious potful for everyone to share. It's a recipe for a good time.",
  " As far as food is concerned, I'm fine with anything. If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it \u2014 yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing.",
  " Quick, come with me! I remembered it's your birthday, obviously, so I thought I'd throw you a proper party. There's food, there's drinks, and I invited a whole bunch of your friends, too. Hey, this is your birthday we're talking about! I wasn't about to let you spend it all alone!",
  " Really? This'll make me stronger? You'd better not be kidding, I have stacks of laundry to do.",
  " It feels like... a fire inside of me has just begun to burn.",
  " I have all of this power, but how should I use it? I need to give this one some serious thought.",
  " Thank you for placing your trust in me. Your kindness warms my heart more than the brightest flame ever could. But not to worry, I've figured out what I want to do now. My strength is your shield, and I will always be here to protect you."

  " I love onions! I've tried cutting them dozens of ways, and they still make me cry... No matter, I still love them!",
  " I can smell Mist Flowers! It must be Dr. Baizhu! What is he doing here? Uh-- Are you okay? Do you feel faint? Is your stomach sore? Or is it a sore throat? I've got it, you're fatigued from all that adventuring! No?... You're fine? Phew! Otherwise, he would have made you drink some traditional herbal medicine \u2014 it's so bitter!",
  " That was the Tianquan! Did you see? She just walked past. Come here... closer... Let me tell you, she knows everything that happens in Liyue, so... keep a low profile, don't attract her attention!",
  " Is Hu Tao picking on you too? Ugh, that prankster always waits till I least expect it, creeps up on me from behind and then... Boo! ...then laughs herself silly. Hmph. But I can handle it, and she does bring me fermented plum blossoms once in a while so I can make flower cakes... so I don't hold a grudge.",
  " Diona, from Springvale! Ah, I heard she mixes a great drink, so I came specifically to see her! I thought perhaps I could use her secrets in my cooking, and bring out more flavors. But the tips that she gave me \u2014 like soaking lizard tails in beer, or putting bits of smoked fish in dandelion wine \u2014 all came out really awful. *sigh* Guess it's up to me to work it out myself, then.",
  " Oh, Beidou is the greatest! Every time I go out sailing with her, she always manages to fish up lots of fresh ingredients! Octopus tentacles go great in soup, and seaweed fries up great with some chilies. *giggle* Not just Beidou, but everyone on board the Crux loves my cooking.",
  " I've come across a lot of fussy eaters, but Mr. Zhongli is very particular and has no problem getting straight to what he has to say. The first time I served him salt and pepper tofu, he took just one bite, and then proceeded to say: \"It would be better to try sea salt extracted from the shallow seas of Guyun Stone Forest, because it would bring a fresh sense of depth to the tofu.\" I tried it and the taste was just so different! He's just amazing, don't you think!?",
  " Chongyun? I always see him on his way to eat at Wanmin Restaurant with Xingqiu... Ah... or perhaps I should say I see him being dragged there by Xingqiu? Chongyun doesn't eat hot food. Every time the hot food arrives, Xingqiu politely apologizes and proceeds to try every dish. I just wanna dig in with him! The look on Chongyun's face is priceless. They're quite interesting, those two.",
  " Ganyu? Oh... Oh yeah! I remember her \u2014 vegetarian, right? She doesn't come to the Wanmin Restaurant very often \u2014 but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time! I wouldn't have guessed she had such an appetite just by looking at her.",
  " Hee-hee, I'm proud to call her my junior! She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe master is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior...",
  " Xinyan always comes to the Wanmin Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine out of ten times, she enjoys them too! She's great.(Actual Voice-Over: Xinyan always comes to the Wanmin Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine times out of ten, she enjoys them too! She's great.)",
  " Roasted pigeon skewers, anyone? C'mon, it's my secret recipe, you'll love it!",
  " My master did a good job teaching me spear fighting, don't you think? If you want, I could teach you too. Although... I'd much rather teach you my cooking, if you're interested! I want my recipes to spread all around Teyvat!",
  " My heart's desire? To start my very own cooking tradition, of course! Li-style and Yue-style cooking are good, but they have a limited palate. The missing ingredient? Chilli pepper! Come, let me fry up one of Guoba's chilli peppers for you...",
  " I think I've won you over with my cooking now, right? It's time to introduce you to my latest masterpiece \u2014 I call it \"the most marvelous multi-colored super pancake\"! Bright red squirrel ham, orange carrot, yellow sunfrog meat, green calla lily and blue butterfly wings, beautifully wrapped up in a thin egg pancake\u2014 What? I thought you said you were starving? *sigh* okay.",
  " I'm in a dilemma and I don't know how to solve it... It isn't like me to get so worked up over nothing... Ah! Well, here's the thing. I always love getting you to try my latest recipes, but... I'm worried that my food might not agree with your stomach and... I can't bear the thought of that happening. What should I do?",
  " Watch carefully! Heat the oil in a pan, then take a handful of crystalflies \u2014 wings removed \u2014 pop them in, and voila! Delicious deep-fried crystal\u2014 Hey! Where are you going?",
  " It's been a month and I still haven't sold a single bowl of Mushroom Slime Stew. Gee, is it just because it looks sticky and gooey? It's their loss if they don't have a spoonful...",
  " My favorite thing to eat is... whatever exotic ingredient I haven't tried yet! No, I'm not dodging the question, that's my honest answer!",
  " I'll eat absolutely anything! There are no bad ingredients, only bad cooking!",
  " Ah, there you are! Come with me, I've prepared a birthday feast all for you! ... No really, I insist! Which dish is your favorite? It's okay, take your time, try them all first, then let me know!",
  " Oh wow! This feels great! My whole body is bursting with energy!",
  " Hey! Ha! Hua! I can slay a beast with one punch, locking in that freshness!",
  " Finally... with this power, I can cook... *giggle* ...Oh no, I've started salivating!",
  " As my father always says: \"To make a five-star dish, you need ten-star passion!\" I know, I know! To be able to come this far is definitely thanks to your ten-star passion when it comes to practicing with me, so I'll be sure to pay you back with two-no, three times the passion!"

I can sew, I can grow flowers and keep fish, and make nice-looking meals. I'm allowed to like anything... or anyone I want, right?",
  " Hobbies? Rock 'n' roll, of course! You ever have that something you put your all into? When everything you love comes together into one thing, the place and time loses all importance. You just need to enjoy it to the fullest, and express yourself to your hearts content! I can never get enough of that feelin'!",

  " The lunch down at the Liyue dockyards rocks! Oily, meaty... Bit skimpy on the vegetables, but I could never get tired of it! Far as I'm concerned, a whole day in the dockyards is worth it just for the lunch!",
  " Not that I'm picky, but I can't stand bland food. If it's supposed to be salty or spicy, make it salty or spicy! You can't have a good time if you don't go all-in on the flavor! Even if all I had on hand were enough ingredients for one serving of Jewelry Soup, I'd make sure I'd do right by them!",
  " Happy birthday! I made some embroidery especially for you. Check it out \u2014 I sewed both our images on in the style of Fontaine's dolls. Pretty cute, eh? ...Why are you looking at me like that? Wh\u2014What, it's not that weird that I can do embroidery!",
  " That's the groove, alright! That's what I'm talking about!",
  " I'm on fire lately. Look out for my next performance!",
  " With such power, who knows what never-before-seen bangers I'll be able to come up with? Thanks so much! My next work won't disappoint!",
  " I feel your awesome, overflowing passion! Tell you what, I'll write you a rock song. It'll be your song - and I'll play it just for you!"

  " My name is Yanfei, top legal expert in Liyue \u2014 and for the avoidance of doubt, no one else comes close! From commercial litigation, to civil mediation, to criminal lawsuits, I'm fully versed in every area of the law, and I guarantee you a swift and satisfactory conclusion to your case! My contact details... Where should I write this down? ...Hmm, paper will just get lost, and it'll only rub off if I write it on the back of your hand, so... Aha! I know, I'll just write it here, on the clothes of this... whatever this thing is that follows you around.",
  " I'll remind you again: The law can be both a help and a hindrance.",
  " Sometimes the law is compatible with human nature, but sometimes the two conflict. Balancing the two is a discipline in its own right...",
  " The case before us... is a strange and unprecedented one indeed.",
  " Rain! Oh, Lord of Geo, please, do us a favor and clear this up at your earliest convenience... I submit that we cannot afford for the codices to get damp...",
  " What the... What kind of injurious weather is this!? It's c\u2014cold... Achoo...",
  " Ah, this weather's got me in the mood for reciting some laws. Let's see... \"Commercial Law of Liyue,\" Chapter 27, Section 6, Article 3 stipulates that\u2014 Wait, what was it...? Oh my goodness, I've completely forgotten! What is wrong with me today...?",
  " I have to head out this morning to meet a client about a creditor dispute, but I also have to follow up on a consultation from last week by noon... Alright, time to get to work!",
  " *yawn* I'm a little sleepy... I know, a vigorous debate should wake me up! And I've got just the topic: \"The Northland Bank's presence in Liyue does more harm than good for our economy.\" ...So, are you for or against?",
  " The night market? Hmm... I was planning on organizing some files this evening, but if you're going, I can join you. Oh, I should mention \u2014 lots of vendors go for the hard sell in the evenings, because they want to be able to start with fresh produce the next day, but also don't want to lose profit on what they have left today.So, leave the negotiating to me. And... If you have any leftovers, those can be my fee.",

  " You think I come across as quite imposing when I'm reading through case files? Huh. Well, that's only when I'm in work mode. It's like... I have an invisible switch, flick it one way and I'm in normal mode, flick it the other way and I switch to work mode. Surely you must have a switch like that, too?",
  " Civil cases are the ones I dread the most. Divorces, custody disputes... It's a thankless task trying to unpack these kinds of cases with logic and reason. You have to be kind, courteous, and patient with your clients, even though half the time they are completely incapable of participating in a constructive discussion. *sigh* I know I advertise myself as being fully versed in every area of the law, but honestly, if it were up to me, I'd rather everyone could just get along, so we wouldn't have so many of these cases.",
  " You want legal advice from me? Sure. For legal opinions, I charge a flat rate of 6,000 Mora, for advisory services, my hourly rate is 180,000 Mora, and for commercial law, I charge 710,000 Mora per case \u2014 final quote and commission rate depending on the details of your case. Not a bad deal, right?",
  " If you're concerned about what kind of complicated issues you might get tied up in during your travels, your best bet is to bring someone with you who knows and understands the law. Someone like me, for example, whose expertise goes beyond just the law of Liyue... Well, actually, having said that, Fontaine's law is notoriously complicated... Though, with my level of intelligence, getting acquainted with it should be no problem! Anyway... My point is, you can always rely on me!",
  " Visions appear in response to strong desire, so as someone with ideals, it's only natural that I should have received one. Because, above all, I wish for all people to live honest lives and abide by the law. But some people will always insist on playing by their own rules and causing havoc for everyone else... Hah, those people can expect to be prosecuted so hard, they won't know what hit them!",
  " This steelyard balance was a gift from my father. It weighs objects to determine their value. I usually use Mora for the weight, but it can only give the original price. For example, a thousand years ago, Liyue was covered in Glaze Lilies, and they weren't worth anything in monetary terms. Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated. It still shows them as their original value... in other words, dirt cheap.So, most of the time, this isn't a very useful tool for work purposes... Hmm? You want to try weighing something? How about... We could weigh your little friend here, will that do?",
  " I have a self-defense method that I call \"Wrath of the Flame,\" based on a punishment called the \"Wrath of the Rock,\" which is detailed in the ancient work \"The Comprehensive Compendium of Liyue Law.\" The Lord of Geo is the God of Contracts, and contracts, too, can be seen as a way of restraining people. Haha, ergo, Liyue Harbor has been the City of Contracts since time immemorial.",
  " The Historia Naturalis Liyue has an entry about a waterborne plant called the Horsetail. It claims that \"The Horsetail is a medicinal herb that stands alone on the banks of Dihua Marsh. Its color is that of the clouds at sunset.\" Apparently, if you grind it into a powder and mix it into your ink, it makes your writing water-resistant. But it's a shame, I've been to Dihua Marsh at least a hundred times, and each time I end up with baskets and baskets of the common purple variety, but not a single one of the kind that the book describes.",
  " I heard that little herb gatherer has written out a whole set of behavioral rules for herself. She may be small, but boy, has she got her head screwed on! She's definitely destined for greatness...\"The young of today shall outperform us tomorrow,\" as they say. I must admit, she has my respect.",
  " Ganyu is kind and thoughtful, it's just a shame she's so busy all the time. Most of the time, she's buried in an endless pile of paperwork \u2014 the only exception being her nap at noon. Don't get me wrong, I have to put in some hours at work, too. But I'm happy with the job I've chosen, and it's certainly a lot less taxing than hers.",
  " The Feiyun Commerce Guild is one of my oldest clients. Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself. Last time, though, I happened to meet their youngest, Xingqiu. To my complete surprise, the lad had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with my train of thought. He was very eloquent, too, and had excellent manners. Mm, definitely not a simpleton.",
  " I always hear people saying that the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an unorthodox approach to business. They think she's gone a little non compos mentis after being in the funeral business so long... What are these people talking about? The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor provides a legitimate and necessary service, which is the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. Work is just work \u2014 there are no good and bad jobs, or lucky and unlucky jobs, just jobs that need doing.If I had one gripe, it would be that the director rarely comes to me for legal advice, hmph...",
  " Mr. Zhongli has so much in-depth knowledge on so many topics, he's like a walking library, you know what I mean? He's a total savant, though he never flaunts it. I could tell just by looking at him. People like him rarely shy away from taking on complex problems alone, so in my estimation he's certainly not a potential client.And yet, somehow, I can't help but think I know him from somewhere, it's hard to describe the feeling... I asked my father about it, and he just said something to the effect of he didn't know either, though he seemed a little evasive. It was so strange... Anyway, makes me wonder if my father is hiding something from me. Hmph, alright then \u2014 if he won't tell me what's going on, I'll just have to find out for myself...",
  " You must have heard of the Tianquan, Ningguang? She's the highest authority where the law is concerned, and often makes amendments to the legal codices. Every round of additions, retractions, and revisions generates mountains of material. Why, the latest edition of the legal codices contained three new laws, 121 revised legal annotations, and an array of new legal precedents. Archons know how long it's going to take me to commit them to memory...Hmph... still, she's a businesswoman at heart, I'm not about to let her beat me when it comes to the law. Once I've finished memorizing these, I need to step up my productivity...",
  " The Yuheng doesn't deal with matters of the law, and thank goodness... Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work. Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way \u2014 no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me.",
  " Eula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all.",
  " A client? Very pleased to meet you, here's my card. I'm afraid I can't leave my desk today, if it's a dispute we're dealing with then please bring the relevant parties here to see me. Let me just give you a breakdown of my fees \u2014 one moment...Huh? You came just to chat? Uh... no fee necessary then. So just to clarify... you came to chat as friends with a legal expert that you've never met before... care to explain?",
  " These antlers? Oh... well my father is an adeptus, so I have adeptus blood myself. Still, I was born during peacetime here in Liyue \u2014 I never signed a contract with Rex Lapis. Naturally, I don't have to concern myself with adeptal affairs \u2014 I'm free to focus on the life I want to live. Works for me! Hee-hee.",
  " Contracts of that magnitude \u2014 lifelong commitments... I've only ever signed one with my father. Uh... it's about living happily, I suppose. That's the kind of person he is. I'm proud of him for that. If he'd wanted me to sign a different contract, say... one about working myself into the ground, or stepping on others to achieve success... I would've ran away by now!",
  " Sometimes, the commercial disputes I handle don't end very pleasantly. The other party might win compensation way in excess of the damages, or pay damages far exceeding the costs... Such is the price of violating a contract. Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!Think about it \u2014 the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout. Making sure that people realize the importance of contracts is a crucial part of my work!",
  " Most of the time, I feel that I have a happy and laid back existence. I have a successful career, clothes on my back, and the freedom to go wherever I please. I've also got quite a way with words \u2014 nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life.For me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me.In any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law. After all, as soon as you stray from the law, the world begins to fall to ruin.",
  " My hobbies are reading and appraisal. Reading begets knowledge, appraisal improves judgment. As such, I read everything and appraise anything. If you don't believe me, bring something over sometime. If there's a market for it, my estimate won't be far off. Take this stone for example... must be... 600 Mora.",
  " My friends from the Communications Office often get me to go fishing with them. They say it's to exchange angling tips, but deep down everyone's keen to show off. I've gotten the better of everyone a hundred different ways, but they continue to scrutinize my business... After so much success, it's gotten a little embarrassing... So every time, I end up taking advantage of my ingenious acting skills to make myself seem humble, you know? What's with the face \u2014 are you doubting me?",
  " Oh! On that note, let me recommend my one true love. Tofu \u2014 tofu all the way! Light in flavor, tender in texture, not to mention smooth and nourishing. It goes well with all manner of soups and dishes, and more importantly \u2014 it's available throughout the seasons! Beauty over complexity... tofu dishes are my kind of flavor.",
  " I don't like cold dishes... maybe it's because I rarely eat them. When I would get home late, my father used to keep a lantern lit for me. He'd hear me coming and ask me if I was hungry. In his words: \"The best dishes are served hot.\"",
  " Happy birthday! Here, this is for you. I've collated legislation from all the nations \u2014 you're planning to go traveling, right? It will serve you well to familiarize yourself with the law of the different lands.Don't study too hard mind you, or else... I won't be of any use to you.",
  " \"Do not seek to emulate the past, for there is no law that can suffice for all time\"... This is a lesson I must always bear in mind.",
  " Only by adhering to the law can the people solve life's myriad of problems.",
  " Studying the law allows one to have grounded conversations, whilst learning martial arts allows one to prevail against groundless violence. Hey, wait a minute... does this count as martial arts...?",

  " Welcome to Naganohara! My name is Yoimiya \u2014 just let me know if you need anything! We have Kushikatsu, Egg Roll... Wait, no, we're not a restaurant. We make fireworks! Like these, see? Sparkling, crackling, little fireworks~",
  " Fireworks are for now, but friends are forever.",
  " If we've got nothing else to do, why don't I tell you a story?",
  " Have you ever kept goldfish as pets? They're very cute.",
  " Ahh, the fireworks are going to get soaked! Let's find shelter, quick! Oh, we're not going to make it!",
  " Haha, watch me make a snowball... pew!",
  " Ah, this is great! I feel so relaxed all over, I could almost float away.",
  " The wind's so strong\u2014! It's blowing my voice back at me\u2014! Hahaha...",
  " Ah... *yawns* Good morning. The morning air is the freshest. Come on, take a few extra breaths \u2014 it'll make you smarter~",
  " Time for lunch! ... Oh my, it's an egg with a double yolk. What wonderful luck!",
  " Now's the best time to test our fireworks out, though I'm sure they'll look good whether they explode in the sky or on the ground... Hehe, just kidding. I'll pay attention to safety.",
  " Question time! So, what should you do after watching fireworks all day? Hehe, the answer is... to watch them again in your dreams, of course! Good night. See you tomorrow!",
  " My father's hearing isn't very good. When I was young, he would always smile no matter what I said to him, and so I thought that everything I said was correct. So I kept talking, and he would keep smiling. Later, I found out that he was smiling because he couldn't hear clearly, but... as long as he's truly happy, I'll keep talking to him.",
  " I don't worry about \"loose lips sinking ships.\" The emotions contained in the words people say don't lie. Misunderstandings that arise from saying things wrongly can be resolved if you just talk more, but if you say nothing, the other person won't understand what you mean, and they can't get closer to you.",
  " Let's have a game of rock paper scissors! On my count, now \u2014 rock, paper, scissors! Woohoo, I won! I won! ... Hmm? I didn't change my choice halfway. Why would I ever do that?",
  " It actually doesn't matter what I do. What matters are the people I work with. When I'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. Talking to you never gets old, after all.",
  " Let me let you in on a little secret. When I first received my Vision, I used it as a flint to light fireworks and boil water, before returning home, chucking it into a storeroom, and forgetting all about it. In the end, it was my father who found it and told me that it was a precious item that I should keep safe. Haha, at least it didn't get taken back by our dear Archon.",
  " Did you know? A lot of the fireworks used during Liyue's Lantern Rite were purchased from our shop. I made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue. Exports like these aren't allowed under the Sakoku Decree, but... How can there be festivals without fireworks?",
  " \"When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence.\" Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.",
  " Did you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded... Quite the sore loser I was, then \u2014 sitting on a rock, sighing to myself and thinking, \"Ah, so there are things in this world that can't be stepped on...\"",
  " While squatting next to some children and watching them catch goldfish during one summer festival, I suddenly had a thought: could I make fireworks that could go off on the surface of the water? Thus, the \"Goldfish Fireworks\" were born! They can swim here and there, emit multi-colored lights, and they can even spit bubbles! I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease.",
  " Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her \u2014 and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright \u2014 they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be \u2014 very pleasant, and a surprise.",
  " Fireworks are probably the furthest thing from the \"eternity\" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has \"eternity\" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.",
  " We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word \"ladylike\" was practically made just for her.",
  " We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths.",
  " He's quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says. Sometimes, it might seem like there's no connection, but as he goes on, everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose. It's... quite different from how I do things. I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle.",
  " Ayaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, \"isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?\" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release the fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?",
  " Oh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?",
  " Arataki's gang? Huh!? So he isn't just someone with too much free time on his hands?",
  " People with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure.",
  " Due to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong... Hehe, then I'll get Thoma to come and help me apologize to her!",
  " Let me know if you see her, alright? I'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. She always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!",
  " Wait, you said there was a kid in Mondstadt who was good at making bombs?... Now, they aren't much different from fireworks. In other words, she might be a genius... Ohh, I'd love to meet her. *sigh* But isn't it dangerous to let children play with explosives? Don't the people of Mondstadt worry about that?",
  " You wanna hear a story? Alright, alright. Sit here, and I shall tell you the story I'm most proud of \u2014 the story of the Naganohara family! You'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?",
  " Our family has a long tradition in which we will give every client who orders customized fireworks a note. Its contents can only be understood by our family, and it records the specific formula of the fireworks that were ordered. Whether ten years or a hundred years pass, our family can make exactly the same fireworks as they did in the past so long as the client brings us that note.",
  " The loveliest fireworks go along with the most wondrous moments. Tiny little emotions that can easily slip away are captured within these fireworks and passed down in a different form. The notes we give our clients are like a key that awaits those who wish to open a gate to commemorate the past. We at Naganohara are the keepers of that gate.",
  " Every moment of the summer festival is a moving tale. Those who meet under the light of fireworks grow up, mature, and grow old. When they set off the same fireworks as they did in the beginning, the skies reflect that same image from years ago... Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity.",
  " I shan't tell the final tale, I think. Instead, let's watch the fireworks together in silence. You can record the beautiful scenery and all the things you wanna say down. Not that this is the end, of course. On the contrary, I believe that our story is only just beginning.",
  " Fireworks! Wait, that doesn't count? Well then, let me think. Um... This one's a toughie. I like to chat with the neighbors, I like going to summer festivals with the children, swimming, picking wild fruits... Oh, I can't decide which I like most... Wait, I've got it! I love playing with everyone!",
  " *Blubbering noises* Hah! I'm copying the sound that Paimon makes while disappearing!",
  " The novel that I've been reading for a while finally reached its end. But the heroine lost her memory, and the planned wedding fell through... That's so... sad...",
  " I prefer snacks to entrees. I always go from stall to stall during festivals, eating as I go. By the way, are you any good at making snacks? I'll trade the dango I made with you. Here, have the big ones!",
  " Ugh... Milk never fails to start some real fireworks in my stomach \u2014 crackle, kaboom! Y'know what I mean? But I can handle dishes and snacks made with milk for some reason, hmm. Maybe the little Seelie in my stomach is just pickier than most.",
  " Birthdays are never occasions for yourself alone. Those who send you cakes, light candles, applaud, and cheer... They are all truly thankful that you were born into this world. That's why it must be a lively occasion, so that everyone can get their chance to thank you! Well then \u2014 happy birthday! Are you ready? I'm about to ignite the fireworks!",
  " The higher they fly, the louder the explosion!",
  " Hehehe, let me give this \"shooting fireworks straight into the skies with a bow\" business a shot!",
  " With all these combat skills I've learned from you, I should just become an adventurer on the side \u2014 apart from my day job making fireworks... Or... should I just become a hero instead?",
  " \"Never fear, Yoimiya is here! Evil begone! Justice prevails!\"Think this is a good way to introduce the powers you've taught me to the children? Isn't it cool? Hehe! Hey, tell me if anyone picks on you, too. I'll stick up for you!"

  " Huh? You like rock 'n' roll? Oh, that's great! I'll be sure to bring you along the next time I go out to see a show. And when I get back, I can just tell the senior troupe members that I went out to visit you... Hehe, that way, they won't have any reason to get on my case about going out.",
  " Hmm? My Vision? Hehe, I suppose the Lord of Geo must be a fan of the opera. Perhaps the old man was so delighted with my performance that he decided to grant me a Vision.",
  " One of my absolute favorite pastimes is trying out all kinds of new beverages. I've already tried all the sophisticated-sounding drinks that previous generations came up with \u2014 you know, like Pine Nectar Tea and Snow Blossom Tea. I'm beginning to worry that I'll run out of new drinks to try soon. You don't happen to have any recommendations, do you?",
  " Sometimes, I just feel like casting off my opera costume and going traveling overseas. You know, to explore the outside world. For now, I'll need to keep working hard at what I'm doing, so someday that dream can come true.",
  " The chirping of the songbirds at daybreak always puts me in the best of moods.",
  " The elders of the troupe are always harping on about rock 'n' roll being a bad influence. Needless to say, they never approve of me going to see Xinyan's shows. \"It's for your own good,\" they say. Hmph, all it's really about is their inability to accept anything new. Whatever, those old fogies can't tell me what to do. I'm going to keep rocking out at Xinyan's gigs, every week, and that's that.",
  " Ah yes, Hu Tao. Very expressive face, and she has a sharp mind too \u2014 you can be discussing the most mundane thing in the world, and she'll always bring out a string of witty remarks. I admire her a lot. There's never a dull moment when you have friends like her around.",
  " The customs of the opera are very particular, and are passed down from generation to generation. Sometimes I find that I only know the hows but not the whys behind what we do. But when speaking with Zhongli, it is abundantly evident that he knows the origins behind almost everything. Who wouldn't be delighted to have such a connoisseur in their audience?",
  " The Tianquan is a big spender and has made several very generous donations to our troupe. I can only return her generosity by delivering my best possible performance.",
  " Oh, so you are also acquainted with Xingqiu? Haha, he is quite the clever one, and with a sharp wit as well. The moment you let your guard down, you're at risk of becoming the butt of one of his practical jokes... Don't say I didn't warn you.",
  " I have long since known \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\" inside out, back to front, but it was only very recently that I learned that the \"divine damsel\" in question is actually a real person. Life is full of strange twists sometimes! My only hope is that she can find true friendship and never be lonely again.",
  " I have yet to see the Yuheng ever attend an opera performance. Now that I think about it, whenever I happen to see her out on the street, she always seems to be in a great hurry.",
  " Kaedehara Kazuha is among the many outlanders who enjoy Liyue opera. Whether it's an orchestral section or a percussive piece, he always sits there and listens quietly. Talk about great manners!",
  " Many of the operas we've been performing recently are new ones that I wrote after assuming the directorship of the troupe. I suppose the fact that I can both write and sing my own material has contributed to my rising popularity in Liyue Harbor.",
  " Per the tradition, actors must wrap their hair, put on full-face makeup and an elaborate costume, and make all sorts of other preparations before they take the stage. There's no doubt that an opera star in full attire looks spectacular, but achieving this look is frightfully exhausting. So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option \u2014 and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy. Fortunately, the good folks at Heyu Tea House are quite lenient with us. Otherwise, we'd be working ourselves to early graves.",
  " At the start of my opera career, I have to say I did let the standing ovations from our audiences go to my head a little. It wasn't long before I developed a captious attitude... If I didn't like the script, or if the stage was too small, or if I thought there weren't enough people in the audience, I would refuse to perform. Looking back now, it was all terribly arrogant of me... my goodness. I shall never let myself become so vain again.",
  " Now that I think about it, the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has been under my leadership for quite some time now. Before taking it over, I only knew two things: how to write opera and how to perform it on stage. I never gave any thought to how to run a troupe. Becoming the troupe's director gave me a crash course in this unfamiliar area and I've experienced all the highs and lows of working with people along the way... Only now do I understand that life mirrors opera, just as opera reflects life.",
  " Well you know, many of Liyue's legends are centered around stories of gods and the adepti, so most operas focus on the supernatural, too. A prime example would be \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation,\" which we have been performing recently. Long-time opera fans adore this sort of material, but in this age of humanity, I would rather like to tell stories about ordinary people. Yes, how grand it would be to sing about the hopes and dreams of ordinary people for all to hear. I've never shared these thoughts with anyone before... Thank you for listening so patiently. I'm fortunate to have a close friend like you.",
  " My hobbies? Well, opera, of course! It's what I truly love and it's what I will be pursuing for the rest of my life.",
  " *sigh* Well, as you can probably imagine, I always have to be mindful of what I eat and make sure I stay in shape. It's a shame, because the temptation to indulge in all the tasty delicacies the city has to offer is just as strong to me as to anyone else...",
  " Tianshu Meat, Black-Back Perch Stew, Cured Pork Dry Hotpot... Oh, I just want them all!  Unfortunately, I basically never get to eat such things, but... um, if you don't mind me asking... Can you cook any of those dishes?",
  " Every day's the same... Stir-Fried Shrimp, day in and day out. No matter how they prepare it, it always tastes the same. Ugh, ghastly! I really can't stand it anymore...",
  " Oh, so today's your birthday? Well, I wouldn't know how to throw you a feast if I tried... so how about I sing you a song? For you alone, an audience of one. So... what song would you like to hear me sing? The choice is yours.",
  " As the saying goes: \"Achievement in a field is the result of how hard you are willing to work at it, not how much you enjoy it.\"",
  " It looks like all my rigorous training is finally paying off.",
  " I began my training in the art of the spear hoping to enhance my performance in stage combat. I stuck with it hoping to master the techniques of self-defense. Today, it looks like I have finally achieved both of these goals.",
  " The art of the spear is a vast and profound discipline... There is an almost infinite number of things one can learn. I am glad to have had you by my side during my training. Haha, I believe I've grasped the basics now. I daresay you'd better be careful when we're sparring together in the future."

 "Zhongli": [
  " A new contract? Okay. I'm still on leave, but I can accompany you for a while. What name should I use on the contract? I have a great many names, though when on leave... I tend to go by Zhongli. And you, Traveler? What name will you be signing on this contract?",
  " Every journey has its final day. Don't rush.",
  " Where do you want to go next? If you'd like to see Liyue's tourist spots, I have a few references.",
  " Boats are made for transferring commodities back and forth, and those that come across Liyue tend to stay a while, so it is where many things come to settle.",
  " Osmanthus wine tastes the same as I remember... But where are those who share the memory?",
  " Violetgrass is a plant that enjoys a moist environment and is best picked after it rains. If you should choose to pick any, be sure to store them appropriately.",
  " We should look for a place to take shelter. I'll be fine, but we don't want you catching a cold.",
  " This weather is no good for being on vacation. We should go and take in an opera.",
  " I hope today too shall be prosperous.",
  " Want a quick meal to pick us back up? I know a good place in Chihu Rock.",
  " By this time of night, we will have already missed Ms. Yun's play, but Liyue is full of interesting places to explore, even at night.",
  " The market is closed and the port has settled. Go get some rest.",
  " Nothing can be accomplished without rules or standards. No matter if it is mortals or adepti, everyone has their place. This rule keeps Liyue in peace.",
  " Gold is Liyue's treasure. It is the blood that runs through her heart. As for whether your own heart shines like gold \u2014 we will have to wait and see.",
  " You and I have a contract, so feel free to discuss anything at all within the scope of said contract.",
  " We can discuss matters that fall outside of our contract too. After all, I have been on this land for a time, and have come to know a thing or two. Of course, I do hope you can do some things for me as well. That would only be fair.",
  " Contracts cannot be used to define friendship, nor measure sentiment. So just what can we use to measure the weight of our emotions? Do you know the answer, friend?",
  " Visions... are also a type of contract. You should know that all power comes at a price. For every bit of power you gain, so too do you gain more responsibility.",
  " Trade relies on both contracts and fairness. There is one thing you must never forget when making and abiding by a contract: if fairness is lost, then the contract shall become proof of one's deception.",
  " If you're heading to Jueyun Karst, please bring me back a bunch of Qingxin. Just one bunch is enough. Travel expenses... Ah, I almost forgot, during the effective period of our contract, travel expenses are to be paid for by yourself. Sorry to bother you.",
  " You speak of the young adeptus of Guili Plains... *sigh* Still fulfilling his duty to this very day. Please give these Remedium Tertiorum to him on my behalf. Oh, yes \u2014 be sure not to let Paimon eat them. Nothing of this world can withstand the power of this medicine.",
  " Tsk... It reeks of wine. That bard has just been through here, hasn't he? That drunkard is a disgrace to the arts. Oh... Has he tricked you into getting drunk? You're slurring a little. Wait a moment, I'll brew a pot of sobering tea. It'll be ready in only six hours, so just wait a moment.",
  " Despite the multitude of affairs she deals with in a day, Ningguang always continues to press on. A rare gem indeed. I'm reminded of the time that she used to walk barefoot from Yaoguang Shoal to the south wharf, trying to sell her wares as she went. Time is cruel to humans.",
  " The current overseer of the funeral parlor? Ahem. I cannot deal with that child.",
  " That rascal from Snezhnaya has yet to depart from Liyue? No matter, just let me know if he gives you any trouble. I shall deal with the matter swiftly.(Actual Voice-Over: That rascal from Snezhnaya has yet to depart from Liyue? Heh, no matter, just let me know if he gives you any trouble. I shall deal with the matter swiftly.)",
  " It's said that Childe and his reputation have yet again stirred up waves among the inner-ranks of the Fatui. Knowing his type, he will be sure to swiftly depose anyone who dares to challenge his actions. Hm... Come to think of it, there will be a lot of interesting news to be heard the next time we gather for drinks. Care to join me when the time comes, Traveler?",
  " Liyue's prosperity has not been merely built on Rex Lapis' oracles or wisdom, it is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time. If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval.",
  " She is the most impious of the Qixing \u2014 but I actually find the conviction of such people quite endearing. The only reason I was able to consider taking a step back from such overarching management of Liyue was because there are people like her. People who speak up when they believe themselves to be right, and then go and do something decisive about it.",
  " Despite never having signed a contract with me, she upholds order within many strata of Liyue society in her own way, dispelling misconceptions and correcting biases... Should her father one day return from his travels, I imagine that he would be even more delighted than I.",
  " Time tempers all volition. Yet she would give up everyone for her beliefs. Perhaps it is for this very reason that she has come to where she stands today... Should the chance come by me, I too would like to learn of the Eternity for which she so earnestly endeavors.",
  " Why is it that, once you finally get a break, rather than taking a rest, you instead come to me? Is it that you want to hear one of my stories?",
  " Have you heard of the origin of the Blackcliff Forge? In the past, they would mine the ore veins of Mt. Tianheng, and then replace the cavities with factory equipment. Tunnels run in all directions throughout the mountain \u2014 some even run to the ruins deep within the earth. I doubt there is a person today who could map out all the tunnels.",
  " Have you heard of the origins of the Lantern Rite? In a war, long ago, the people of Liyue would release lanterns to remind their soldiers of the way home, and to never lose sight of themselves. Though in this day and age, I doubt there are any that remember.",
  " The God of Contracts. Have you heard of him? He has an impressive memory. He remembers the name of every person he comes across, and the date that every ship in Liyue sets sail. After all, only in being able to do so can he memorize all of the contracts he holds. With that said, not every memory is a happy one...",
  " For those that live too long, the friends of days gone by and scenes from their adventures live on in their memories. As such I have no regrets in meeting you, friend. Should the day ever come that we are not together, you will continue to shine like gold in my memories.",
  " I enjoy partaking in walks through the city \u2014 when time permits. I find it very calming. Yes... Just when did this feeling begin...?",
  " To get people to abide by a contract, and act in accordance with the guidelines set out within, is simply to ask them to respect the concept of fairness. It is not a large request. How are there those who still do not understand such simplicity?",
  " There was once a drink I used to enjoy with friends \u2014 long ago... Is it because the climate has changed? A shame I will never be able to relish in its smooth flavor again.",
  " I don't like seafood. Just seeing it reminds me of that... slimy texture, and that scent that just won't wash off. As for why I hate it... *sigh* It's a long story, so let's just say my memory is a little too good.",
  " Happy Birthday. This is a dried glaze lily that came into bloom on the day of your birth. Long ago, the people of Liyue would say that this flower blooms bearing the weight of the beautiful memories and prayers of the land. I believe this to have been applied on the day you were born as well.",
  " It seems my strength is returning. Not a lot, but enough.",
  " My power is growing, and so with it grows the burden on my body... I'm okay. My structure is not the same as that of normal people. Please do not worry yourself.",
  " I see. Using a Vision harnesses elements. As far as the common folk are concerned, this is no small feat. So... back then.. they were aware of this as they stood beside me...",
  " After letting go of my Gnosis I never expected to see a day like this again. Thank you, friend. Ah, yes, I have a new contract here. Care to take a look at it together?"
