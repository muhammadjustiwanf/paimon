# Windows
* i've already prepared a standalone binary, didn't include source because windows is not target os
# Linux
* run `make` in current directory to build binary from source.
* also including binary so you don't have to build form source
* it's not really recommended for git repos to have binaries, but for now, it is better than compiling binaries every time repo is cloned.
