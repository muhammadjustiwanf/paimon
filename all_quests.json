  "description": "Katheryne seems to have a new commission for you.This commission involves traveling to Tsurumi Island, which is shrouded in perpetual fog, to help Sumida gather material for her novel and find the Maushiro. According to Sumida, there is someone on Ritou who can take you all to Tsurumi Island.Using Kama's boat, you arrive at the mysterious, fog-shrouded island to help Sumida put her novel together. Next up, you need to go deeper into the land and retrieve this so-called Maushiro.According to Sumida, Tsurumi Island's civilization should have ceased to be for millennia now... But somehow, there are still people alive here.You met a young man named Ruu rather out of blue and made offering to the perch in a somewhat haphazard manner. According to him, Tsurumi Island must conduct a certain ceremony, and the ceremonial site is a place where Maushiro will gather. It is time to head to the site and speak with the priest responsible for the ceremony.The Tsurumi locals are behaving a little oddly, but you take their commission to make offering at three perches nonetheless. As long as the ceremony goes smoothly, you should be able to get your hands on the Maushiro and complete Sumida's commission.You completed the three offerings to the perch and spoke to Ruu, who appeared out of nowhere, about many things, including saying about The Rule of Three. Since you have made offerings at three perches, things will probably go smoothly from now on. It is time to return to the ceremonial site and speak to the priest.There is no one at the ceremonial site, You almost feel a bit cheated.Although you could not participate in the ceremony, this is not why you came to Tsurumi Island anyway. Now that you have the Maushiro, it is time to report back.",

Head down to the camp in the foothills to ask around. Perhaps someone might have a clue as to your next course of action.The first shard flew up and away after being thawed out... According to Iris, there are two other shards here on Dragonspine. If you follow the strange blue plants, you may be able to find more shards of this sort around the Entombed City Outskirts and Starglow Cavern.Following the mountain path, you discover a Statue of the Seven. Beside it, the path up the mountain extends ever on...You successfully reach Dragonspine's summit from the cavern. However, you see a strange pillar from which those frozen shards seem to have fallen. Those shards also seem to have become frozen once more, requiring you to thaw them out again.After unfreezing the three shards and letting them return to that mysterious pillar, the ice surface beneath the pillar broke, revealing a large space underneath... Perhaps you can return to the adventurers at the camp and report what you've seen here on the summit...",

  "description": "It has been a while since you last contacted Sumida. She said earlier that she would look for some of the other people who took up her commission and conduct an information exchange. Go back to Inazuma and look for her to see how her attempt proceeds.The other people Sumida commissioned to go to Tsurumi Island all met with more or less similar circumstances. However, you are determined to get to the bottom of this no matter what. If nothing else, you will finish this commission, if it's the last thing you do.Even if the Thunderbird's feathers are the primordial Maushiro, they are probably not what Sumida is looking for. However, according to Ruu, they do possess some special power that may yet be of some use.Though you gained nothing from going to Tsurumi Island's ceremonial grounds earlier, you do obtain a Maushiro thanks to Ruu's help, so as agreed, you head to the ceremonial grounds to have a look. Listen to what the locals have to say and see if there is anything you can help them with.According to the locals, they need someone to help them find Ruu. This trip is starting to feel like a waste of time... But you might as well have a look around the island to see if you can find any other leads. They say that Ruu enjoys hanging around Wakukau Shoal, Oina Beach, and the Autake Plains \u2014 First stop, Wakukau Shoal it is, then.You fail to find anything at Wakukau Shoal... Well, mostly, anyway. Your illusory conversation partner has revealed that Ruu may have been here earlier. Regardless, it is time to check out Oina Beach.You fail to find Ruu at Oina Beach, but an illusory Kama greeted you instead. This will be worth remembering, you think, for a future conversation with Kama himself. Now then, off you go to the Autake Plains to see if Ruu can be found there.You see an illusion that seems to resemble Ruu at the Autake Plains. Perhaps this is worth investigating further.This search has proved unfruitful. Time to head back to the ceremonial grounds.It is hard to describe all that has happened here on Tsurumi Island. Still, a Maushiro in hand is a Maushiro in hand. Now all that remains is to return to Inazuma City and submit the goods to Sumida, and your commission shall be complete.",

This is something that usually only happens in the novels you've read. However, what he describes lines up with the strange things that you have seen happen on Tsurumi Island. In which case, the most important thing to do right now is to go and help Ruu.The conversations you've overhead from the Tsurumi Island natives \u2014 well, illusions of them, to be precise \u2014 must be the key to breaking through. Since you wish to disrupt their ceremony, then you have to destroy the all-important perches, which are needed for that ceremony.From the reactions of the illusions of the past you see on the island, destroying the perch seems to have had some effect. Well, then. One down, three to go.Now that all the perches on Tsurumi Island have been destroyed, the ceremony can no longer be held. Next up, time to check on the results of your hard work.You witness a scene akin to doomsday occurring at the ceremonial site. This must be the terrifying sight that Ruu has seen many, many times. Left with no choice, you and Paimon flee the scene together.As per your commission, you need to head back to Inazuma City to report to Sumida.",

  "description": "Whether you're here to help Ruu or finish the commission, it's time to head to Tsurumi Island once more.Kama's attitude has changed a lot from when you first met him. He expresses the desire to come along and help Ruu. Whatever the case, since he is the descendant of the illusory Kama, perhaps he does have the ability to turn the situation around. Head with him into the terrifying cataclysm and search for Ruu. First stop, Wakukau Shoal!Perhaps it was due to an energy resonance with the Thunderbird feather you obtained on Amakumo Peak or the destruction of the perches that caused the situation to change... But though you failed to find Ruu on Wakukau Shoal, you were able to perceive what might be the Thunderbird memories, which should serve you well in making sense of Tsurumi Island's situation. Time to see if you can find Ruu on Oina Beach.The last place left to search where Ruu said the storm does not touch is Autake Plains. You will be able to find him there for sure this time.Ruu spoke of The Rule of Three: that you must first overcome three difficulties to succeed on your fourth attempt. Now that you have explored Tsurumi Island three times, this fourth excursion should surely end in success. Time to head to Mt. Kanna, where the Thunderbird once dwelt, next.You finally find Ruu and come to some sort of understanding with him.The thing that answered your call was the very same thundering monster that you once defeated on Amakumo Peak. It takes some effort, but you see its challenge off nonetheless. If the circumstances here are similar to what happened before, you should be able to find some of the Thunderbird's memories here as well.It is time to help Ruu fulfill his promise to the ThunderbirdReport back to Sumida and finish your commission.",
