# Guides setup

**Adding new characters**

    Adding folders name for additional characters in characters.json, will add them to bot!

**File Naming**

    builds folder should have character builds whether in jpg or png.
        Naming should be like this for build.

            sub_dps.jpg, its title would translate to Sub DPS in discord embeds.
            main_dps.jpg, its title would translate to Main DPS in discord embeds.
            support.jpg, its title would translate to Support in discord embeds.
            healer.jpg etc, its title would translate to Healer in discord embeds.

    ascension files can be named as you want as their titles are not translated in discord embeds.
